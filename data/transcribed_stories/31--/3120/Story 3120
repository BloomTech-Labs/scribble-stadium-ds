Once upon a time there were best 
friends who where playing.One friend got 
hurt by a ball.Pysten got angry and said "do 
people always get hurt."Dan just nodded. Before 
Dan could say another word, Pysten left. 
Dan went back inside his house. When 
Pysten got back to his house, he went 
into the basement. He thought about what 
Dan said. He was going to change that. 
Pysten made dark magic and put them 
in some halloween hats. The hats began flying 
around the room.At Dan's house Dan was 
medatating. He like medatating, espceialy when 
he's alone. When he went to be a shooting 
star feel from the sky.When he woke up 
he saw the star. Before he could pick it up 
it got in his hand.It have him powers. [erasure]






           .Pysten gave up and wanted 
to be friends again
