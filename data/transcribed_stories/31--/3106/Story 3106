Me and my friend had a fight about 
which game had better graphics. I said "No 
fortnite does!" He also said "No PUBG does!" 
We kept arguing and arguing. Till about 
the next week and then we stopped just 
a little bit more. Same thing for every 
week we jut kept stopping and stopping 
a little bit more. Finaly we stopped and 
said "lets just stop talking about it" Then 
everything was back to normal once again.



P.S. But seriusly Fortnite does 
just my opinoin.
it's really just a better 
game!
