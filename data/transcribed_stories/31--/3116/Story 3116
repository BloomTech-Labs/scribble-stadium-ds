So once there was
 a turtle name Cacti.
 He lived in oasis in the 
 desert. Cacti was very nice 
 and wanted to go somewhere 
  but if he did he would 
  be baked by the sun and 
  he would have no coconut
  milk. One day he had an 
  idea he could tunle
  through the old log and 
  find another home
  with friends but when 
  he got through he relizo
 that he ontop of and 
 under river. He found 
 a zip lind \cart and 
  roled down to the bottom 
  and rilezed that he had 
  found and old mining 
  site and there was 
  a skylight and the 
   palms would drop coconuts 
   in. He went back home 
   to pack. Once he was 
   settled in he relized that 
    zipline was still new.

then one rock moved 
 it was an other 
 turtle! He once thought 
 of where he came from and 
 that turtle was his age 
 maybe he had a sister. 
 Sudenly the othe turtle 
 said "hello my name is Coconut 
 what is yours". "Cacti" Cacti 
 said. "Where are you from"he 
  asked " I don't know" said 
  Coconut " but you can stay 
   I would like another turtle 
   around"said Coconut." I'll stay"
    said Cacti and they 
    became best friend forever.
