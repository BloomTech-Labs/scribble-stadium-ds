Hi my name is Lia Clark. My twin sister's 
name is Mia. One day me and my 
sister where walking to school when a girl came 
up to us and said "what's your problem" and was 
looking straight to my sister, and I could see 
tears filling her eyes. I whispered to her and 
                 Mia
said "It's okay, ^ just ignore her. As we walked 
away, I kepted telling her to take deep breaths.
When she settled down a bit she was quiet the 
whole way to school. That night after dinner 
me and Mia said we had to talk to Mom and 
Dad. We all gathered for a family meeting 
and we told them everything that happened.
After we told them they told me and Mia 
if this happened again they would call the 
school and find out who it was. The next 
day it happened again and we knew we 
had to fix it, so we told the principal and 
she said she knew exactly who it was. We 
knew we wouldn't have this problem again!
We high fived and walked home talking and 
laughing. Everything was back to normal for 
me and Mia!
           The End
