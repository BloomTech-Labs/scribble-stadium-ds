Hi, my name is Mia ^ and I go to The Park Street Middle School. 
I have a twin sister named Lia. One day in school, 
when Lia and I were coming home from school, 
  We saw a cute pomeranien on the street, 
we decied to take it home and ask our parents 
                               we
to take it to the vet. So when ^ got home Qia a shed
"Mom, Dad, can we take this puppy to the vet?" they 
both nodded yes so we drove to the vet and 
they said everything is fine. So then we went 
home we playedwith the puppy and named it 
Fluffy. Then when it was time we gave it 
to foster place.
