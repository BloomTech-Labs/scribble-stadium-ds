Hi my name is Jem Hartin. I love reading 
book's it is my absoulot favorite 
thing. But one day I saw a book on 
the back It said don't open and 
it looked very old. It had no name 
to it So I took it home. 
  I thought to myself what is 
this book about and why does it 
 say do not open. I started reading 
 and I finished the book in about 
15 min and wehn I was closing 
the book and thon I went 
inside the book the book came 
  to life then I heard a 
 person say "Hello" a fellow said. 
 I said "were amI" I said "your 
 are in the boo" the fellow said. 
 "You have to defeat the dragon and 
get out town gem back". Jem 
  said "ok". So she called for 
 the dragon. It looked very 
 Scary and tuff. She was 
 not beliveing in herself but 
 then she remembred her favorite 
 song called Lost Boy. She 
 started to sing " there was a time 
 When I was alone

nowere to go and no Place to call 
 home...". and on and on she 
  sang and suddenly the dog on 
  dissapered and gave the gem 
but Jem was vanashing out of 
 the book "thank you" all the 
 towns people said and then she 
went back to her house she opend 
the book one more time and it 
said this is a book for you 
 to belive in yourself"
