One hot day in spring Molly was 
taking a walk and it was a Thursd-
ay so Molly took a shower and 
ate her dinner and Molly went 
to bed and when her mom 
asked "Did you do your homework?" 
Molly freked out so bad she 
dicided to do her homework 
at night but Molly couldn't 
see and her mom was in 
the livingroom. So Molly just 
went and told her mom "I forgot 
to do my homework". And Molly's 
Mom said to just leave it 
so Molly did. Molly told her 
teacher. And Molly teacher told 
Molly "It's okay but don't forget 
next time". So Molly did her 
 homework in class and she 
 knew now.
