My alarm clock went off. I got out of 
bed, put on my slippers, and went to feed my 
cats. "Cheech, Penguin!" I only saw Penguin come. 
"Meow." She purred. I changed my clothes, 
brushed my teeth, and ate breakfast. "Hey, 
Jeevan?" I asked. "What?" "can you help me 
look for Cheechee?" "Sure." he said. We were
walking down the sreet and then I saw 
paw-prints. I followed them, but they led to 
my house. I opened the door. I heard a 
meow, and thought it must be Penguin. 
But Penguin was fast asleep. I opened 
my brother's room door. "Meow." I opened 
his closet door and... "Meow!" Cheechee burst 
of the closet. I hugged him and went
out side. I wondered who's pawprints 
were they. Then I saw Sweetie,(my dog) 
playing in the dirt, leaving brown paw-
prints wherever she went. As I went in-
side I thought to my self, Mystery 
solved.
