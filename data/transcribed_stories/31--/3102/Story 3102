The secret fifth grade
I am Amelia I am starting fifth grade.
I have a little siter named Emma, Emma is
goining into kindergarden, with her triplets
Ava and Isabella, but I don't care
about them. When I was a 3rd grader
we learned how to invent. This year I 
will try to make an invention that 
a robot will go to school for me. Got to 
go to sleep. zzzzzz. I wake up 
get changed, brush teeth, and do hair. 
I have long curly brown hair. I used 
to wear glasses and braces, and once 
broke my leg. I am 10, I will turn 11 
in November. The school is called Los Angeles 
elementry school. I live in Nevada and 
will drive there. It is probabaly an hour. 
When I walked in Mrs. Begula said 
Hello! Mrs. Klapeia, my last name. I said 
hi. I have to share a desk with Brittney. 
My schedule: Math Writting, reading, vocab, spelling, 
typing, and social studies. It had said NO 
Lunch In Fifth grade! When I was 
in second grade Kayla calle me a division 
Decimal. I did not like it. We had to make 
division problems and they were all with 
decimals. Class dismissed said Mrs. Begula. 
Now I was not a witch, vampire, or godess, but I 
made a sock from Emma and made it 
do my homework. When it was time to go 
I didn't I made a blue robot the whole 
night. Blue is my favorite color, but it only 
had a blue shirt because my teacher would 
notice it is not me. I sent it out with 
my mom. I went on my phone, until Ava 
came in my room. She said loudly 
Why are you not at school! Good thing 
she did not notice. I had to say something 
um I am sick. Cof cof cof. Oh I see 
let me tell Isabella. Isabella I heard she 
said. No said Ava. Should I tell Mom if 
she's really sick. Um no said Isabella 
play with me. Isabella already new 
about it. It the robot came back. 
It worked yay, and that is my year 
of fifth grade, When the home work 
is home. You are are doing my homework!
