 It was a quiet Night in the library. 
All the books were sleeping except 2 books. 
They were books X and Y. "I can't sleep," 
Book X said. "Me neither," said book Y. 
There was a quiet than light. The 2 books 
woke up. "Morning guys", called book H. 
Suddenly the door opened and customers 
came in. One girl said; "I like that book", 
she said pointing at book X. She left. 
Book X turned to book Y. They both 
knew what that ment. "Quick", said 
Book Y. "We need to hide". They 
jumped off the shelve. But they 
 couldn't Walk so well. In the distance, 
book X saw the girl coming, "Come on", 
move". He said. Suddenly someone hit 
book X's side and he flew through the 
air and bounced all over the librar,Ytill 
Crash! The books and the shelves 
came crashing down. The customers screamed 
and ran. The two books hopped on an 
electric book cart, Book Y got at 
the wheel and the cart zoomed out 
of the shop. Far away, Book X saw 
police cars following them! He saw 
an ink launcher, got on it and fired, 
BOOM! Went the launcher, 
                 page 2
Ink shot out and the Police 
sweved to avoid it. BOOM! BOOM! 
BOOM! BOOM! went the sound of 
the launcher. Finally ink hit the 
cars which went flying off a 
cliff! "Back to the librar y"! Yelled 
book X. The cart shot through the 
library. The books flew through 
 the air and landed in their places. 
The castomers came in and the 
libray was peaceful once more.
