" This is my jungle. I had it first and you cannt not 
steal if from me." screamed Lion. "I have Known 
this jungle longer than you were born and it is 
a matter of time till I rule this jungle." Tiger 
shot back at Lion. Tiger and Lion are having a 
fight because they think that one of them are the best 
and can rule over the jungle and if you want 
to know what the solution of the story is you have 
to keep reading but the only way to solve this 
problem is for Tiger and Lion to go to the peace-
keeper because they were once best friends. "The only 
way to solve this problem is to go to the peacekeeper." 
said Tiger. So in a tree probably taller than the sky
the peacekeeper went to work with Lion and 
Tiger. "So what is the problem?" the peacekeeper asked 
in a deep voice. "We both want to rule the jungle." 
They both said. The peacekeeper said "Jungle Affwire
is a very old jungle but I have an idea. The idea 
that the peacekeeper had was Jungle Affwire will probably 
die in about two years so Tiger could rule for a 
year and Lion could rule for the last year and the
idea worked and Tiger and Lion had happy lives.
