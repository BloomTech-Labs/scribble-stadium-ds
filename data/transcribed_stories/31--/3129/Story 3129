 the building. "You can guard and I will look for the

 you can guard" said Katrina. They argued but found 
 a plan. They would both look and Caterine's cat and 
 Katrina's kitten would guard because they were 
 very fierce. They soon found the trophy room and 
 Katrina used her claw tool to break the glass. They
