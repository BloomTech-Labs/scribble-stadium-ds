Once opon a time, 
There was a cute Kitty. 
He was walking near home and met a cute puppy.
"Hello," He said. "My name is "Starburst." 
"My name is fluffy," The dog said "My Mom is faster 
than yours." 
'Well my mom is stronger." Starburst said. 
The Animals began to fight. 
Fluffy charged at Starburst whaKed him back with 
 strengthened power. 
At the end Fluffy was too tired to fight. 
"Hey I got a great idea," Starburst Exclaimed. "Our 
parents can work together to make a great 
hunting team." 
The Moms agreed and they lived happily ever 
                after.
