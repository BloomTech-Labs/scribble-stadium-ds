Billy
   and The Ant War
  Long, Long ago there was a giant 
ants roaming the land the size of 
a chapter book. There were two types of ants 
the grove ants and the hyping ants. 
The grove ants wanted peace for all 
ants but the hypings wanted death 
and kaos. There were 7 different ^ sections
                                  land

battle field, grove up ground, grove base, and groe 
land. So far the hypings were wining

There was a []grove ant who just 
 graduwated from war school and his 
  name was Billy. Billy had idea 
  to Stop this war and it's with 
  his favorite word,"Why?" So Billy 
  ran across the field until he 
   reached the Wall. Billy stayed 
    there for days maybe even 
   weeks until he heard the 
   words, "draw em' down!" The 
   draw bridge came down. Billy 
   rushed inside and the hypings 
   [] came outside holding, a 
   RAM! [] Billy[] had to hurry 
   now athor wise the groves will 
   lose! []Billy went Up the stairs 
    to the rulers office and said, 
   "Why are you doing this?" He swivted
   and said, "Because I'm mad." "Why?" 
   "Because no one helped me when 
   I was little." "Why?" "I don't know!"
   said the ruler. A year later all 
   of the hypings apologized the 
   war ended and everybody 
  was happy, all with word WHY.
