The pony that didn't know. 
Once there was a pony that 
noone payed attention to. Her name
is Snowlight Star. On Christmas 
morning she escaped to know 
why she was treated like thin air. 
She said to herself "where should I go?' 
The next day she found a casle 
of ponys. She ran to find the head-
mistress. When Snowlight found her 
in the tallest tower, she asked "can 
you help me find why no one 
ever talks to me?" The headmistress 
said "that's easy, because I wanted 
you here. Snowlight said "Why 
would you want me here? 
The headmistress said "come on 
of you pop. By the way, my name 
is Headmaster Samantha. 
The net day she had already made 
tons of friends. Their names are 
Elisa, Tessa, and Lina. One day 
she was very angry because her 
friends wouldn't tell her anything 
so she stomped her hooves and 
they came right to her and told her 
everything. They were planning a surprise 
party for her and she ruined it 
being a surprise! She felt so sorry. She 
learned to wait for her friends to 
tell her. She also, learned she was 
magical. The End
