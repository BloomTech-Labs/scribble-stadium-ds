A girl that lived in New York City
 saw a dog that lived in a box and 
  She wanted to keep it but her
  mom said it was too much work 
   and every day She walked past 
   it to go to school and frowned.
   Days went on and on. Then one 
  day her mom Said we can feed it 
  on the way to school. So they did. The girl 
   dreamed and dreamed about rescuing 
    it. Also it was a Yorkie without 
    a name. Soon it was Christmas she 
    got lots and lots of gifts 
     she wanted but not a Yorkie. Her 
      birthday is in May. The girls 
       dad was a billion air and 
       they lived in a penthouse at 
      the top of her dads 80 floor 
      tower. Her dads tower was 3 quarters 
       filled with cars he had only 
        the finest cars. Her birthday
        was coming and her parents 
        got her the Yorkie she 
        named her Cutie also she 
        was the most spoled kid in
