 One day a boy named Ishaan and a girl named 
 Sarah were having a war. Not just any war, this 
war was a dialogue war. What I mean by dialogue 
 war is a fight with dialogue. Ishaan wanted 
to get a dog and Lily wanted to get a cat. 
"I think dogs are the best pet because the playful 
 and cats are steathy and unfriendly. "Are Not"! 
"Are to"! "Are not"! "Are to"! And as you can see 
 it went on and on. Finally, after two 
 hours of endless bickering there 
 mother came and said that they could not 
 get a pet. 
          
            The End
