I was in Austrillia exploreing
the goeat forest, how there 
was some things that I've seen 
there, , now when, I was walking 
through that forest I found 
a creature It was a plant but 
it was unuasal it had huge 
jaws and it was foaming 
I saw a monkey go by it 
the monkey was inspecting 
it, 1 second later all I could 
see was a tail, I needed 
to get past this thing 
but, I didn't know how to, 
I came up with an idea, 
I had matches and a lighte.
you never know when your going 
to need them but, I throwed 
It at that thing and the 
sound it made screaming 
wailing thing but it stopped 
when I looked back i was 
burnt to a crisp, now I put 
the fire out of course with 
my water tank and that was ne-
the end of that I will tell 
you more storys but it is 
late and, yo need to go 
to bed little one," but I don't 
want to," go to sleep ,"ok," 
goodnight , " goodnight."
The 
End
