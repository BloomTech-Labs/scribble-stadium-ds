"Ughhh, this is going to take forever!" Pri groaned leaning her head 
on the table. Pri and her friend Julie were designing a dress for 
a fashion show in Paris that was in 2 weeks. "Cheer up Pri, we just 
started. I'm sure that we'll find an idea" Julie said. "Ooo, how about 
this?" Julie said picking up a book with a cool design. "Thats cool. 
But I was thinking of drawing something else" Pri said looking at the 
design book. "Suit yourself, I'm going to draw something similar to this 
design." While Julie was drawing sketches, Pri got up to find another 
book to look at. While she was walking, she spoted a book that had 
a shiny golden cover that said, "Designs for girls." She broght the book 
back to the table and started to skin through it. Then she saw a design 
that was absolutely beautiful, it had golden silk with red lace 
woven through it. Without hesitation, she started right to work. After 
2 more hours drawing and coloring, Pri and Julie were finaly done 
with their drawings. "So, how do you like mine?" Julie asked showing 
Pri her paper. It was a tunic with blue silk and green lace along 
with high tops and navy jeans. "Its awesome! Now how about mine?" 
Pri asked showing Julie her drawing. It was a shirt with ripped jean shorts 
and the shirt was golden with white lace. "Well I think I like mine 
better" said Julie. "Are you saing mine's not good?!" Pri said highly 
insulted.  "No!" They fighted the rest of the time they were there. 
Then they went home. Pri went to her room, and all of a sudden 
something mind blowing happend. She called Julie and told her 
the idea to combind there creations, and she agreed! they 
worked and worked until the show and they both came 
there wearing... their outfit they made!
