 One day Bob took a stroll. He 
 didn't notice he left his house 
 unlocked! "He He He" said Jeff. Jeff 
 was going to rob Bob's house!!!
 Bob just kept walking he didn't know 
 what was happening back at 
 his house. Later that day Bob 
 came home. He saw lots of his 
 stuff missing, "OH NO!" said Bob 
 "someone robbed me!" Bob was so 
 mad, Jeff was rich now. Bob 
 called 911... "Hello what is your 
 emergency" said the polic "someone 
 robbed me help!" Later the FBI 
 showed up (and the police). Bob told 
 them his Ferrari was gone, his 
 wallet was gone, even his puppy 
 Mr. doge! They figured out (from 
 the fingerprints) that the criminal 
 was Jeff McBoogersondoodle. Bob 
 said "Hey, I know him he was, 
 hmm... oh yeah he was in college 
with me!" Bob was in shock. The 
police said "We're gunna track him 
down 'till we find him."  They went 
in the cop car and they found 
Jeff. He was in his new house.

His house was ^ 100 feet tall
mansion! He had used all of 
Bob's money to buy that. Also guess 
what Jeff had parked in the 
 driveway Bob's red Ferrari. They 
 went in and found Jeff watchin'
  some ding dang TV.
