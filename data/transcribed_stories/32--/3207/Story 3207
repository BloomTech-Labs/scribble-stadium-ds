owner Lilly. Lilly was taking Sophie to the park 
and Sophie brought her dog bone. When they got 
to the park Lilly asked Sophie "Do you want 'to  . 
go on the slide"? Sophie replied "Bark Bark" 
which ment yes. So they went to the slide 
and played for along time until Sophie 
said that she got bored. So Sophie "Woof Bark 
Woof" which ment lets go to the swings. So 
Lilly and Sophie went to the swings. And 
they stayed there for twenty minuts until it

bone at the park! So the next day they 
went back to the park and found the bone 
laying on a swing., Sophie was so happy
