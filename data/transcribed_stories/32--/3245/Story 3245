Navi   Potato Kingdom
 Josh was sitting in his bedroom 
thinking about how much fun his 
  friends were having while they are 
 in vaction. But then he remembered 
 the book the mysterious book his 
 grandmother gave him. It was kept 
 in the closet quietly so nobody would 
know about it. He opened his closet 
and snatched his book and opened 
    []
his book to the second page and 
there he saw Potato Land and he 
 touched it. Suddenly "WhOOSh" he 
was in Potato Land; and how did 
he know that?- There was a potato 
guard  standing right next to him. 
  The potato guard took Josh hand 
with a grab and boomed"What are 
you here for?", Josh said in his 
squeaky voice. "I just came here". 
Suddenly the potato guard grabbed 
 Josh's arm and then said in deep,  
 dark words "die or in prison", 
Josh mangged to squeak "prision".
 Suddenly he was just there in person 
  thinking about how to get out. 
 Then suddenly he got a big ache 
  Navi                       - 3245
  In his head while thinking 
  about how to get out! Then 
  he started to go a bit calm and 
  suddenly he realized why - because 
  he was holding on to the book. 
 Josh's hand started to suck in 
 the book and he screamed "No".
  And there he was back in his house, 
 in his bedroom, laying on his bed. 
  He couldn't wait to tell hi[] Friends. 
 Now he knew what fun is - Adventure!
