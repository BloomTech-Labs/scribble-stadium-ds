One day three deers were wondering 
the forest when all of a sudden 
the mokey with black eyes and silver 
teeth jumped down from a tree. He 
grabed the baby deer and hoped back 
up the tree. The mom and dad deer 
said to the monkey "hey, give us back 
our son." The monkey said "good for 
eating deers are." and then he hoped 
away. The mom and dad deer named 
Milly and Bob ran after the monkey. 
However the monkey was way to 
fast so after a while the stoped to 
rest. As they were walking they came 
apon a little house in the middle of 
to trees. They went and looked inside. 
Inside they saw to men talking. Then 
won said "hey there are deers outside 
the house." When they walked outside 
Milly asked "can you help us. This 
Monkey took our son." The men looked 
at each other with a surprised look 
and said a monkey took our sister 
too. Mabey it was the same Monkey. 
So they set to work making a plan. The 
next day the deers went to where they 
had lost there son the monkey came and 
                       3247

deer the man named Sato shot the 
monkey and killed him. They fallowed
