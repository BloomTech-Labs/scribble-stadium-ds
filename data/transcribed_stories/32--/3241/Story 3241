 Once there was a girl named Sylvie. 
Her best friend was a girl named Alissa. 
They had good times together. One day 
Sylvie sprouted wings (She was actully 
half human half angel) and Alissa said, 
“Hey! Why do you have wings I’ve 
always wings not you. Hmph!” and she 
stormed of before Sylvie could 
explain. After that Alissa was always 
making mean comments  about Sylvie wings 
and ignoring her everytime she tried to 
 talk to her. One day Alissa’s new best 
 friend named Katlyn said to Sylvie, 
“Hi Sylvie I think you should say sorry 
to Alissa and I have to go now!” and she 
raced of leaving Sylvie by herself 
she decided to explain to Alissa that 
she didn’t get wing on purpose so 
she  went to Alissa and said, 
“Alissa I didn’t mean to get wings 
I just inherited them sorry.” After 
that they became friends again.
