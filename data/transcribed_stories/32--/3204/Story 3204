 Long ago there was two astronauts named Potatoe Head 
 and Crusher. That one summer morning they were going to space 
on the Challenger 2,000. This rocket ship is supposed to go to the 
newest galaxy discovered in 1964, with a camera they saw something 
  moving with a hand with sparkly stones. On the rocket ship 
 Potatoe head said to Crusher "I'm a little scared to see what 
 is on the Wabalara Galazy" "Same" said Crusher in a frightened 
 voice. Bob the man who wa"s running the blast off said "10-9-8-7-
 6-5-4-3-2-1" blast off! Righ out of the blue there was 
  KABOOM and the air was filled with smoke Potatoe Head's 
  head was filled with sweat and the same with Crisher's 
 Once Crusher and Potatoe Head was in the Wabalara Galaxy 
  the people down on Earth started celebrating and the they 
  saw the man with the hand with sparkly rocks so Crusher 
  and Potatoe Head went down to the planet and once they 
  got on the planet they lost connection and they started 
   panicing badly. And they saw a huge palace with 
   guards and the guy with the and with sparkly rocks 
    And he was on a throne! Crusher and Potatoe Head decided to 
    investigate they were both retired spys. "I don't think I want 
   to do this!" Said Potatoe Head "we have to learn about 
   the galaxy, and we have to get back.

  Once they got inside they heard the hand can destroy earth 
  so they had to get the hand before the man's evil 
  plan suceeds. they dug a hole and hid until the Purple 
   Grape they heard his name they snuck inside and got 
  the hand and once they left the planet they got 
    connection and they would live happily again!
