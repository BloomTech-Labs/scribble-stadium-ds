One day Arnold and his dog rothesweler were 
walking, when all of the sudden rothesweler 
started barking at a sewer drain. Arnold had 
absolutly  no clue why he was barking so he 
decided to figure out. He looked down 
 the drain and saw a treasure chest that 
was of weird shade of floresent green 
he looked at the chest  to examine it 
closer. He told  Rothesweler "you realy have found 
something, good boy!", His dog barked "woof, woof!" 
and then motioned toward the chest . Soon he 
   could make out some words and a 
 name but, they were all in spanish .Arnold 
 could not read Spanish so he called his 
 friend and said "Jessica I need some help 
 translating something to spanish" so Jessica said, 
 "read it to me." after reading it and 
 Jessica translating it Arnold knew it 
 said whoever finds it shall keep it. 
 Jessica said she should got sone 
 to but, Arnold said "finders keepers" 
 so they argued about finaly they made 
    agreement Arnold would get 60% and 
 Jessica would got 40% and then they 
 went of enjoying the riches of the 
 treasures they found. The END
