Once there was a girl who lived in San Fran[]
California. She always wanted a cat. Everyday
at least 10 times she would beg her mom. 
One day even before the girl could beg somemore 
the mom said "get in the car." Then the girl 
got in, she thought "maybe my mom is mad." When 
the car stopped the girl looked out the window,
and said "thanks mom you are getting me a cat." 
Then the mom said "you're welcome sweetheart" 
and they got out of the car. When they went to 
the pet shop there were so many cats that were 
too expensive so then the mom was like "sorry 
we are not getting a cat these are too expensive." 
Then the girl finds a one dollar cat and says 
"mom look i found a cat that's cheap" They 
buy the cat and leave the store. As soon 
as they get home the girl takes her new 
cat to her room and deciedes to name her 
molly. By now it's nighttime so the girl 
puts Molly on the couch and the girl 
goes to bed. Then the Girl hears somebody 
say "hey want to talk." The girl looks around 
and notices that the cat had talked. Her mom 
who's bedroom was next door had heard it and 
opened the door to the girl's room. The Mom 
said "I heard something talk. The girl said
