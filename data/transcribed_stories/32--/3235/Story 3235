I was walking home from school It was 
a beautiful friday afternoon I couldn’t 
wait to go and play with the dog 
my parents got me last night for my 
birthday today as I opened the door 
I called my dog “Lucy!” Lucy was a 2 
 month old Alaskan Malamute My 
 parents came back from the back 
  yard carrying a brown puppy “Where’s 
  Lucy?” My parent s put her in the sink 
 and she put her paws on the side of 
 the sink she was cute but no 
  lucy Mom gave her a bath 
and when she was done lucywas 
  in the sink! “She got out in the 
  yard and we couldn’t catch her!” 
 mom said I picked lucy up the 
 same way as when I first saw her 
 I kissed the top of her head I 
  knew it was going to he a good 
  weekend then there was my 
  older sister who came down it 
  was not going to be a good weekend
