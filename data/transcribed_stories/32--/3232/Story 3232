 One day Nick and Matthew were fighting in their house. 
 "I did not steal your book!" said Matthew. 
 "yer you did!" said Nick. As they were fighting, 
 their dog started barking and growling 
 at both of them. "Sit, Max!" said Nick. 
"I would had given your book back by 
now." Said Matthew. Then Nick said, "no, you 
wouldn't have, because you are so selfish." 
"I have no idea where your'e book 
went!" said Matthew. As they continued to 
fight, the sky grew darker and darker. Then, 
Nick said, "fine, I give up. I don't need 
it anymore." do you want me to buy 
you a new one" '" asked Matthew. "why? 
Nick said sadly. "because I do not 
 want you to feel sad that you 
 don't have your favorite book because 
 it's gone." said Matthew. "that woud make 
 me feel much better then I am now" 
 Nick said, sounding happier. "ok" Matthew said
 then, two days later, 
 "Hey! my books here'" he said. "thanks" "your 
 welcome" Matthew said "I just didn't want 
 you to feel bad, that's all" he said.
Nick was very happy now that 
he had his favorite book with him.
