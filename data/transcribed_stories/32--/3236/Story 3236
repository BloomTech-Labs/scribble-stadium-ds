Once there was an alien that 
came down to Earth. Everyone ran 
away but one. A little boy who was 
just staring him. The alien walked 
closer and closer. But the just stood 
there. The boy said hi and the alien 
said hi. They went to an arcade 
 and played alien shooting games. 
The alien thought this was unfare 
and they started an argument. 
When they saw each other again 
they bought a video game where 
 the humans attack the aliens, 
but the aliens get there revenge. 
So they were happy again.
