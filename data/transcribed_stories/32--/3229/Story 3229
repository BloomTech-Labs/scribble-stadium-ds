  Hi my name Jeff and I am 
  
  the owner of Bob the cow 

  and I am riding my cow I am 

  five years old. If you 

 are wondering why I am riding 

  a cow, it is because I 

 am not allowed to ride a 

   car. I bought ths 

  cow from a farm and because 

  I am allways late to school. 

   I love my cow because 

  it is very fast .
