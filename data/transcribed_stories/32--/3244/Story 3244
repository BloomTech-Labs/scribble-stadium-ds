Once there was an pickle, his name was 
Pickle Bob Joe. And his best 
 fried Orange Awesome. They were 
 once on an island for vacation. 
  They were walking on the beach 
  Then they were hearing a 
   growling sound. Pickle Bob 
    Joe said "hey whats that 
   sound"? Orange Awesome 
   said "eh, who cares". Then 
   they hear it again. They both 
   just ignore it. But they 
    hear it again. They look 
    left, right, all around, and 
    still can't find where that 
    noise was coming from. 
     Pickle Bob Joe were should 
    we go? Then the ground 
    rises. It's and underground 
    volcano Pickle Bob Joe. 
    It's about to erupt water. 
    Get ready. Ahhhhhhhh!!!!
    They both scream. They land 
    in the water on top of a 
    flying dragon. Wait is this 
    Jeff the Dragon. Oh yes it 
    is. Let's go home guys. Jeff says.
