   Arania stepped outside and made sure 
no one saw her.
  “I wish for a pencil, I wish for a pencil, I wish for a 
pencil.” Arania whispered fiercly under her breath. 
Her birth animal, a dragon named Weather, fluttered above 
her head. As every baby born, she had been born 
with a birth animal. She had named her’s Weather, 
so Weather had powers of weather. As for Arania, she 
had the power of wishing. According to her parents, 
no one had had that power in a while. 
   As Arania kept whispering, sparkling light began to 
swirl like a miny tornado. She stopped whispering. 
It swirled faster and faster. Then stopped. In it’s 
place stood a pencil.^ Arania felt like celebrating. 
               sharpened and ready.
[]Not many people could get a sharpened pencil on 
their first try. Weather blasted her with a gust of 
wind. Arania almost forgot about Weather. That was 
unusual, Weather never stayed quiet for so long.
   Weather exclaimed, “Look! Someone is falling from 
the sky!”
   Arania looked up. She was right! Someone 
was falling! 
   Arania thought fast. Maybe she could make 
a mattress. She wished for one. Instead, she got 
a trampoline. She didn’t need a trampoline!

   She needed a mattress! She tried again. 
this time she got one, and just in time.
