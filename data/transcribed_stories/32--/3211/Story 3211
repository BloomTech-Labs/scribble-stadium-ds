I sat. I sat even more. The paper Mrs. Layla gave us about 
creatures of the sea is so long and the top is boring Why do we 
even have to read this paper?All the students in Mermaid School 
who have been past Year 4 say Mrs. Laya is the best. Then 
something cathes my eye at the bottom of the page. I read 
the bottom. After I read, I understand why Mrs.Layla is the 
best. I get 2 mermaid talk pals this year plus some creatures to 
visit and talk too. I quickly scan the classroom I just have to 
hope it is not Lily. I do not want to be with Lily. Her sister 
Tanya is really nice though Mrs. Layla comes in she tells us its 
time to get talk pals. Everyone is excited. She calls people. Then 
she says Amber. I look up. Amber is my name. Mrs. Layla says 
my talk pal in class is Tonya. I walk over to Tanya. "I just 
can't believe I'm with you," Tonya says. When I look at the 
classroom I see Lily doesn't have a partner. "Mrs. Layla, I don't 
have a partner," said Lily, crying. "Oh, its okay Lily" say Mrs. 
Layla kindly "Oh right I put you with Tanya and Amber. 
I gasp.So does Tanya. Lily is kind for the day. We get two 
talk pals from Sandville school, a sea turtle, sea enicorn, and two 
penguins. Me and Tanya are so happy and squeal. Lily doesn't like 
penguins and is upset. We don't know whether we should trade our 
penguins for dolphins. Lily loves dolphins. We argue till our talk meeting 
with our talk pals.We decide to get 2 dolphins but keep the 
penguins. Lily is so happy. She over comes her fear of penguins
