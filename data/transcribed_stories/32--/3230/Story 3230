Once There was a King named 
baylaf, he ruled over a huge empire. 
Every time someone broke the law 
he would send them to the dragon 
living under the kingdom, "Think about 
what you did." he'd say to the 
prisoner. But one day the dragon 
was gone he called his advisors, 
"Fraddle and Fred, get down here!" 
 Fraddle asked "What's wrong baylaf?" 
 The king replied "The dragon is missing.'" 
 Fred exclaimed "I knew it!" The king 
  was puzzled "What do you know?" 
 Fred made a long story, "So first 
 I heard some rumbling and roaring, 
 then a big crash happened. After 
 that I heard the flapping of wings! 
 So I thought maybe the dragon 
escaped." the king was very afraid, 
"Okay, so what your telling me is 
 that the dragon escaped." Fred said 
 "Yes my great King." Baylaf ordered, 
  "I want the best knights and 
   archers to get me back my 
   dragon!" And so fred and Fraddle 
   got Oguk and Ogurk the best knight 
   and archer in the kingdom.

 Fraddle orded, "Find the King's    
 dragon you two, and bring him 
 to Baylaf alive." Ogurk said, []
 "Understood, we will find the dragon." 
that knight Oguk and Ogurk got 
 on their horses and headed 
 west. Oguk wanted to know why 
 they were going west, "Why are 
 we going west?" Oguk asked. Ogurk 
 replied, "We are going west becuase 
 that's the way the dragon went." 
 Oguk was about to say something 
  but then a tremendous roar happened. 
"What was that?" Oguk asked. Ogurk 
 saw it, the dragon, Ogurk answered 
 "The dragon!" Oguk fired the trana 
 arrows, "Attack" he shouted. Ogurk was 
 gone,"Orgurk!" Oguk called but as the 
  dragon was limping Ogurk jumped off 
 the rock and stabbed the dragon 
 making it crash into the ground. 
"We did it!" Oguk exclaimed, "Let's take 
 it to the king," Oguk said. And 
  When the dragon was returned, The king 
 remembered, he forgot to chain 
up the dragon.
