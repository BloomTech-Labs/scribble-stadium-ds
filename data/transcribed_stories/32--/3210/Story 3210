It was a hot sunny day and princess 

Amanda was out on a walk. When 

Amanda was born her father gave her 

a necklse. this gave her the ability to talk 

to animals. So on her walk Amanda 

ran into a unicorn and this unicorn was 

hurt, so Amanda used her neckls and said to 

the unicorn "whats wrong and how did 

you get hurt?" The unicorn was' ' surprised! 

that Amanda could talk to her. Thet unicorn looked 

with it's sad leyes and; said "I was strolling 

throgh the forest and sodnly a hunter

so sh stode up and said "I am going 

to help the hurt into my casttle and 

there I will nurse you And for the unicorn

  shed." Then Amanda caryed the hurt unicorn 

 into the casttle she told the gaurds
