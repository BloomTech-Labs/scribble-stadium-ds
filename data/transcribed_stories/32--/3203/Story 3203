On one sunny, morning Jack woke up and was very surprised 
                                    eyes
of what he saw. Right infront of his ^ was a dog. 
Now there was something about this dog that Jack 
noticed. Jake asked the dog a question and asked 
   the dog "do you have a superpower"? And surpris-
ingly the dog answerd! The dog could actually speek! 
Jack got dressed for school and secretly put 
the dog in his back pack because the dog 
asked Jack if he could come to school with 
him. On Jack's way to school, his best friend 
Brian came running up to him. Jack said "hey 
Brian, you want to see something cool"? "Sure"! hel
said. "Come over here, I'll show you something." Jack 
carefully unpacked the talking dog from his back pack. 
"You know what, meet me hear right after school", 
said Brian.

After school Brian and Jake showed up at the 
same place. Brian quickly found out that the dog 
could talk. Brian begged Jack if he could keep 
it and since earlier that year Brian had done 
something very nice Jack gave him the dog. 
After that, Brian went home and played with 
the dog for the rest of the day. 

Brian loved the dog.
