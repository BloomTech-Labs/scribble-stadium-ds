Once apon a time there were humans with 
alien assitants one of them were Lucy and 
her alien helper Scribbles. Scribbles was a 
common name on their planet. So Scribbles 
and Lucy went to the store then they 
went to go play outside but Scribbles did not 
        so
want to ^ they had a fight. Scribbles 
yelled “We can have fun inside the house!” 
Lucy said “But we need our vitamins from 
the sun!” There fight went on for 2 weeks 
before they stopped to rest but the next 
day... you hear bickering, screaming, and yelling! 
You’d hear from Scribbles “Well you can play video 
games or board games!” or from Lucy screa-
ming “Well going outside is better than 
hurting your eyes” but then Scribbles 
realized going outside is better and he 
agreed and they both lived a 
 well Ending.
