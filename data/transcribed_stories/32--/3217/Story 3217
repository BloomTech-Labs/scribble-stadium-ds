Who was the strongest!? They both 
   got furious! Emily grabbed a 
  relic looking object. Kat grabbed a 
  nother. They slamed it with anger. 
  It broke! A green light came a 
  sucked them in! The world had 
  looked  just like theirs! The difference 
   was it was night time and 
    there was only a mansion. 
   They decided to go in. Emily 
   claimed that it was spooky. 
 "Quiet!" whispered Kat. "I can sense 
  sonething. Emily opened a little 
  door and saw a little stuffed 
  animal. Kat touched it and the 
  stuffed animal moved! "Hey!" it 
  screamed. "I'm here to sleep!"."Sorry."
