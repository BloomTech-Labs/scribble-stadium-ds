Once there was a girl named Lusinda.

Her dream was to be a horse back 
rider when she grew up but the thing was 

that her parents didn't want her horse back 
riding because they didn't want her to 
 get hurt. "But mom!" Lusinda shouted, 
  "you now my dream is to be a horse 

 back rider, and if i'm going to be a horse 

 back rider I need practive. "Fine, you can 
 start lessons tomorrow". "Thank you thank you 
 thank you THANK YOU!!!" Lusinda 
 was so happy that she decided to 

  look for horses online! She found 
  the horse she wanted, it was white with 
   a strip of pink in her mane. Since she 
    was 16 years old she went and bought it 
    by herself. Her mom was very happy for her. 

    The horse came the following week.
     Lusinda named her new horse Glamour. 

                                             -3208
  She and Glamour got along very well. They started 
  riding the next day. all was great, and Lusinda 
  never got thrown of.
