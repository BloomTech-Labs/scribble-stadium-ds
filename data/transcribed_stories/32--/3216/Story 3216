Once in the land of Dragon 

City lived a Dragon prince, who was 

brave and kind to all who lived 

in the city, but things were not 

so peaceful, Prince Ferdolot was an 

Elf who had his own City it was 

could Elf Morea, the two citis 

were in a big fight. 

Yo[] kigdom has take are water
and food sorce" said the Dragonprince 

"I have not done such" said Prince 
Ferdolot. 

Day after day this went on, but a 
small boy named Redmore was tired of 

the fight so he asked the Dragon 
                               3216
Prince, "Why are you an Ferdolot fighting. 

"That is simple, a while back me and 

Ferdolot were friends. but when we 

went on a quest and he betrayed me" 

"how?, asked Redmore. 

"Well when we reched the Cave of 

Wonders it was full of gold and 

dimonds, and when I was not looking 

he took everything he didnn't even 

leave a gold nugget, and started 

a kigdom, and he stool the one 

thing I got from the Cave the 

Ender Eye of Crensendo.

"Well sounds to me you and Ferbolot 

both hate each other. but I 

have a sulootion". You do? 

Yes. I think you can go to 

Ferbolots City and tell him what 

you want to tell him. 

Mybe I will do that. 

"Ferbolot I want to apoologize for 

all the years I have been mean 

to you, I am sorry"
