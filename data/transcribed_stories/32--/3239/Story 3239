  Once there was a little girl named Rachel, 
Rachel was a very clever girl, and everytime 
her teacher asked her a question She would 
have the answer to it, and everytime 
she had an exam, she would always brag 
about how good of a score she got but in 
a mean way, “Look Rachel I got a 69 on 
the math quiz.” said one of Rachel’s classmates, 
“WHAT! A 69 is horrible I got an 100, that 
means your not smart! Haha!” said Rachel 
 Rachel is always way too cocky but 
that changed today... When Rachel woke 
up she saw something glowing on her 
window when she went to go see what 
 it was she saw a little person 
and when she looked closely it talked 
“Hello! Rachel.” said the little person, “AHH!!” 
she screamed. “My name is Elvis, I’m an Elf!” 
Rachel kept her eyes open so wide she 
couldn’t blink for five minutes. “I came here 
to tell  you how cocky you always are.” 
said Elvis. “Cocky? What does that mean?.” 
asked Rachel. “It means you are to confident,” 
“Explained Elvis. Before Rachel went to school 
she put Elvis in a box and put it in her 
backpack.

When Rachel got to school she couldn’t 
move because she got a feeling, “Am I cocky” 
she asked her and when she went to sit 
at her desk to get ready for the quiz, 
she thought that maybe its not a good idea 
too be cocky. And then she said sorry to 
her classmate.
