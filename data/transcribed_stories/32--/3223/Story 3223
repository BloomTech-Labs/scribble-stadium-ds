"Hello im Evie and heres my best friend 
soul. I walk to school every morning with my 
neighbor, Samy then I meet up with Soul a few 
blocks away. Soul is actually a ghost but 
nobody knows. Our school is actually haunted 
by spirits who usally Just pass through our 
hallways. I know our school is haunted because 
Soul tells me and I have mv ahost speaker 
which allows me to hear the spirits and what 
they talk about. I tell other kids and only 
one kid besides Samy and Soul. The one 
 kid is Marcy whos 12. Shes also 
 friends with Soul. After a week 
 at school we had an assembley about 
 Safety until the lights went out. I heard 
 a voice scream run its in the Cafeteria. 
 I went straight past the cafeteria and 
  ran the the boiler room were the 
 green light the olny light was on. I climbed 
 on top of the tanks and hid near the light. 
A second later I saw the "thing" it had 
 red eyes it was a black figure with 
  a red shadow, it had long nails and teeth. The 
  minuet it came into the room the lights 
  came back on and the only kids left 
  ware me and Marcy. The school closed down 
  and that was the end.
