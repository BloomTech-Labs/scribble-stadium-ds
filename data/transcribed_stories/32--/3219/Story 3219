 One day a robot fell out of 
 the sky. His name was Roboto. He 
 had fallen out of the sky the 
 same day a kid named Bob 
 was born. Bob was born Helena,Montan[]. 
 That is where Roboto had fallen. 
 Roboto had fallen in the room 
 that Bob was born in. He had 
 fallen on Bob's lap the octosecond 
 Bob was born. Bob and Roboto were 
 each very hurt so they had 
 to stay in the hospital longer. Well 
 Bob did. Roboto had to go to a 
 science lab. After that they 
 met up again 5 years later. "Hi 
 Roboto" said Bob. "Hi Bob" said Roboto. "I[]
 haven't seen you in a long time." 
 said Bob. "I know." "I missed you" said Roboto. 
 "Well enough with the talking, wanna 
 play hide and seek"? Said Bob. "Sure" said 
 Roboto". "Last one to that wall is it"! 
 Said Bob. 3 2 1 Go! And they were off. 
 Bob runs track and Roboto has super 
 speed so they both had an 
 advantige. It was a close race but 
 Bob won by an inch. "Yay" said Bob! 
 "Good Job" said Roboto. Then the mom said

"Who wants lemonade and cookies"!? 
"ME"! Shouted Bob and Roboto. "Then 
come and get the"! Said the mom. They 
 both ran inside."Can we eat outside'" 
 asked Bob? "Sure". Said the mom. Then 
 they both rushed outside. Bob 
 said "I have a secret place to 
 eat. follow me". They both went through 
 the bushes, then Roboto couldn't belive 
 his eyes.(Well not really they were 
  cameras but you know what I mean.) 
 Anyways Bob had made a place with 
 a table and chairs so they sat down 
 and had a meal. "Bob"! Mom shouted 
 "Time to go". They couldn't play hide 
 and seek but at lest they had 
 their meal so they said goodbye and 
 left. Roboto had secretly camped 
 in Bob's backyard. THE END
