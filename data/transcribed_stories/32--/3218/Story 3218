Pengu and Pufu were best friends. 
Pengu was a penguin while Pufu was 
a pufin. Pengu was kind and very 
wise. Pengu was known for being 
the best in Antartica. Pufu was weak 
and he was to shy to have friends. 
Pufu knew Pengu was kind and 
wouldn't make him feel bad so 
they decided to be friends. Bearu 
was a polar bear and he wanted 
 to eat everyone. He really 
wanted to get ride of Pengu. 
Pengu really didn't mind because 
he knew how to face Bearu. 
That is why Bearu was smart. 
He thought if he got ride 
of Pufu it would be easyer 
to get ride of Pengu. That 
day, Bearu told Pengu "Pufu is 
dead"."A big fish ate him". Pengu 
was sad and walked away. 
Then Bearu pushed Pufu into 
a lake, getting ready to 
eat him."Ahh" shouted Pufu. Sudenly 
Pengu was with an ice rope 
and ran to save Pengu. Bearu 
                    -3218
was glad. The plan worked. 
Bearu opend is mouth so Pengu  []
could run right in but instead
Pengu put the rope in Bearu's 
mouth and pulled Pufu out of 
the lake. Bearu was in hospital 
for over a month." You must 
enjoy being a good friend". exlaimed 
Pufu." I do." responded Pengu."But I enjoy 
being your friend more".
