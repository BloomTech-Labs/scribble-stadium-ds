It all started when I was locked 
up simply becaues I was not from 
this planet called earth or at least 
that is what I think it's called, 
anyway I was locked up for 
 no reason. I have done nothing 
 to the people of earth (at least 
 not yet.) I saw a few people like 
  me when I was put what 
 I think someone called prison. 
 there were were also humans behind 
  bars. I yelled at the 
 gaurd, "Get your hands off me!" 
 the gaurd just said "no," and put me 
 in my cell. Great, but great I 
 thought to myself. "How am I going 
  to get out of here?" I said to 
 myself. A few days more in 
 prison and then I met a 
  human who was framed wanted 
 to get out of here. He thought 
  he could get out of here 
through the sewer but I thought, 
 why not just go through the 
  front door.
