  The two animals Jenna and Lena were both 
narwhals. They were both best friends. 
 "What do you want to do today," asked Jenna. 
Lenna said, "Well, I'm hungry." "Maybe we can eat." 
Jenna said, "Okay, let's go eat then." The two narwhals 
got some rice, but then when they looked back it was 
gone! Jenna said "It's all your fault, you stole it!" 
  "No I didn't," Lena screamed. "Well then who 
did it," questioned Jenna. "SERIOUSLY, STOP 
BLAMING ME," Lenna yelled back. 
"Ok, ok you didn't have to yell," stated Jenna. 
"Well, I can if I want," Lena stated. "Lenna this 
is enough, you are being way too bossy," said Jenna, 
"I hate you!" Lenna said "Let's not be friends 
because you are blaming me for something I did not 
do!" 
Then the two narwhals Jenna and Lenna 
saw a shadow in the water. 
"Did you see that," questioned Jenna. 
"Yes I did," said Lenna. 
"Hi," came a voice, 
"DID YOU STEAL THE RICE," 
questioned Jenna. 
 "NO, No, of course not," said the narwhal, 
 "Come on tell the truth," said Lenna 
                                         5261

 "Fine, I did," said the other narwhal "I'm sorry." 
 "It's fine, but don't do it again," said Jenna. 
 "Also, I'm sorry for blaming you, Jenna," said 
 Jenna, "BFF's FOREVER," shouted Lenna!
