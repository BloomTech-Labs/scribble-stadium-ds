   Once apon a time, my dog was a 
bit sick. I was freaking out. I did not 
know what to do. I asked myself, 
"Does he need to go to the vet?" 
I didn't think so. I just thought 
it was normal. The day after, he 
was throwing up and everything. I 
knew something was wrong. 

  The next day, I asked the vet, 
"Can I go to you? My dog is 
 having a big problem with its 
  stomach. It was throwing up 
 and even pooping all over the place. 
 He could do better than that." I 
 brought him to the vet. The vet said, 
"Your dog has a stomach bug. He could die. 
It is hurting him and making him go wild. 
 It is even leading him to not 
 be potty trained anymore." I 
 was worried. The vet did all 
 he could to cure the dog. The 
  next day, I went to see if 
 the dog was okay. The vet said, 
 "It will take approximately a 
   month for him to recover." I 
  took him back home. []

     2 days later, he got better. 
  He got better quicker than We thought 
  he would. I called the vet, and 
  said the good news. He was 
  amazed. I enjoyed having him 
  as my pet. He is a miracle. 
  I am lucky to have him. 
  He was lucky enough to not 
   get himself killed.
