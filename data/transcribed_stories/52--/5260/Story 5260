     Fighting Over The Burger        5260  -
John was walking along when he saw a big, juicy burger. 
 It was right next to a stream. John went to go get 
 the burger. As soon as he got near the burger, a frog jumped 
  out of the stream. John was holding the burger. He was 
  so scared, he fell into the stream with the burger. John wanted 
  to eat the burger because he was a very sanitary 
   man. Before he could take a bite, the frog said, "Hey! 
  Why did you steal my burger?" John was wet and cold 
   and he was very angry at the frog. He said, 
  "I WANTED TO EAT THE BURGER!!!!"
 The frog, with his eyes open, said, "Look man, you should have 
  asked." John was enraged and he was upset that he 
   could not eat the burger so he kicked the frog and sent 
  him flying into the stream. Now this frog has had a pretty 
    bad day, some guy stole his burger and kicked him 
   into the stream. The frog, (who was very smart) called 
  up some clickens and asked them if they could get this 
  guy and start pecking him. The chickens came and started pecking 
  John. John climbed up a tree and belly-flopped into the water. 
  He searched for the frog. He found him and he apologized for 
  hurting the frog and offered to share the burger. He 
   agreed and they were all happy.
