 One day, two friends were arguing over 

 what ice cream flavor they wanted 

 to eat and what topping. You see, 

 they were the type that wanted to 

 match, to be like twins. I guess that 

 they always did the same thing, 

 although it probably got a little 

 boring at times. Anyway, they were 

 arguing. I don't know their names, 

 so let's just call them 1 and 2. 

 Basically, 1 wanted vanilla ice cream 

 with sour gummy worms on top. 

 2 wanted mint ice cream with 

                              5245
 chocolate chips on top. Such a hard 

 decision! As I munched on my 

 ice cream, I watched them fight 

 over the flavor. Hey remember what 

 I said at the beginning, that they 

 matched? Well, they were even wearing 

 the same thing! I wonder what they do 

 on days that they couldn't see 

 each other. Back on topic. 

 "We ALWAYS eat mint ice cream!" 

 exclaimed 1. 

 "No, always VANILLA!" exclaimed 2. 

 It kept on going like this for 

                               5245
 awhile, until the storekeeper was 

 afraid there would be a physical 

 fight. Which is why they tried to 

stop the argument. Tried and failed. 

They argued and argued, and it 

seemed as if the fight would 

never end. I guess if that was 

the case, they probably wouldn't 

be friends for a while. Then, I thought 

that that would be a shame 

because what kind of 

best friends break up over 

an ice cream flavor?  Not mine, 

                                 5245
certainly. They argued and argued, and 

 for some reason, I found it 

 to be very interesting. I tried 

 to look away, with no sucess. 

 The Irealized my ice cream 

 was melting! I debated with 

 going back home, but decided 

 I just HAD to see the end 

 of the argument. Would there 
 
 be a conclusion? What if 

 they started hating each 

 other? Now I didn't know if I 

 wanted to go. Would there 

                             5245
 be violence? Hatred? Bad 

 possibilities began to fill my head. 

 All of this... over ICE CREAM. 

 If you actually read the entire 

 story and didn't skip ahead, 

 you're probably thinking, "Sheesh. 

  All this over ice cream. "But, you 

  don't know these kids. I went 

  to summer camp with them 

  before, (and promptly forgot their 
  
   names) and it was NOT good. Each 

  kid was SOOO selfish, it wasn't 

  even funny. Each wanted their own 

                              5245
  thing, and wouldn't give up. 

  I wanted to see the result of 

  this conflict. Usually, they went 

  half-and-half. But, our ice cream 

  shops were very picky. They didn't 

  allow half-and-half. Only full. 

  You could either get two seperate 

  full ones, or decide which. And 

  from what I head, they only 

  had enough for two. One for 

  each. They were either not going to 

  agree, or not have ice cream. 

  Then... the ICE CREAM CAME 

                              5245
   ALIVE!!! Everybody ran for their 

 lives, and so I guess they never 
  
  ice cream after all.
