Once upon a time there was 2 animals, a bunny named, Billy 
and a hedgehog name, Jerry. Jerry saw Billy playing at the park 
with his friends. Billy's friends do not really like Jerry, so when 
they saw Jerry, they ran away, but Billy walked up to Jerry and 
said, "Would you like to play with us?" When Jerry heard the question 
he was so happy. Billy and Jerry went to Billy's friends and said, 
"Let's play!" Billy's friends took Billy to the side and murmured, 
"No way we're playing with him!" Billy whispered back, "Fine we don't 
have to play with him, but what about giving him at least one chance." 
They screamed back at him, "NO!!" 

Billy and his friends walk up to Jerry and they all give their 
opinion. Billy's friends went first. They said things like, "You are 
selfish, annoying, and mean!" Jerry almosst cried but he kept 
himself together. Jerry screamed "Fair enough!" and ran away. 
Billy did not know what to say so he followed his friends. 
Billy's friends found Jerry crying. Jerry said, "Leave me alone." 
Billy's friends started to scream, "Cry baby! Cry baby!" 
Jerry screamed at them, "Why are you picking on me?!" They 
said, "You are so weak!" Jerry threw his thorns at them. 
Billy's friends said, "Fine we will play with you
