          Bird Battle                5238  -
  Life or death. Kill or be killed. That's 
what we were told. It was a war over 
 the declining quantity of food that we had. 
 We didn't have a choice. We were born into it. 
If we wanted to eat, we fought. 
 It was the battle of the birds. 
Falcons vs. eagles. []
It started witha diplomatic meeting: 
"How about I take the birds, and you take 
the mammals?" asked the falcon, but the eagle 
was not content. He then brought the war 
to stage two, stealing food. This went on 
for years, until it finally lead to one side 
having to be extinct, and the other having the 
food. 
  The battle wus between the pergrine 
falcon, and the harpee eage, two representatives 
from their sides. The falcon tried to reason 
with the harpee eagle, but to no avail. After 
a nearly fatal strike from the eagle's large 
talons, the falcon finally struck back. "Don't 
make me do it," he warned, but then he climbed 
in altitude until the air was to thin to go 
any further, he execute the world famous dive. 
   He dropped his wings, and heading beak first 
shot downwards. At the speed of a bullet he 
 hit the eagle right on the neck. That was the end.
