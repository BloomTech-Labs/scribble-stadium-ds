"What?" questioned Emma, "my dog is going 
to die?" Emma had a pug, not any pug 
but a magical pug. Dr. Williams said, "Blue 
has 48 hours left to live." Emma knew this 
was not true because Blue's magic was 
that he could never die, ever. The problem 
was nobody in the whole world who knew about 
Blue's powers. Emma could not tell the vet 
or else Blue would be taken away.

Emma had no other option but to just play 
along. What was there to do? Tell the vet, 
keep it a secret, do nothing. Emma played 
along with the doctor until it was time to 
go. In a panic Emma hid Blue in her closet. 
Why, who knows. 

She wanted it to seem like Blue died. 
72 hours after Emma went to the vet 
she got a knock at her door. "Open 
up!" exclaimed an unknown voice, "we know what 
you did!" Emma opened the door and she was 
startled to see Dr. Williams with 4 men 
dressed in black and sunglasses. All of them 
rush in without saying anything and go 
straight to the closet. 

                                    -5249
The men swung the door open and what 
did they see. Blue on the floor dead. 
After all Dr. Williams was related to 
Blue after they went to the vet. To 
this day nobody knows how Blue died.
