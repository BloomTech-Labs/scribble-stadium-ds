Rebecca sat down. Her notebook in front of 
her, the pages blank. She tentatively opened 
it and drew. Her drawings dwelled on the pages. 
"Honey, dinner!" Mother Helen knocked on 
the door. "Coming, Mother!" Rebecca closed 
her notebook and slid it into her suitcase. 
She ran down the wooden steps when 
suddenly, she fell. She fell and went tumbling. 
A hole appeared at the bottom of the stairs. 
Rebecca fell into that hole. She passed 
dogs, she passed ladies in heavy dresses, 
she passed bicycles. Then, she finnaly landed 
in Ohio. Except it wasn't Ohio. Ladies 
with wings fluttered by. Weird men in dresses past by. 
Rebecca stood up. She started to walk, but 
she was stuck. She wiggled and grunted to 
try to set her feet free. A fairy flew by 
"Excuse me?" Rebecca smoothed her dress. The 
fairy gasped. "Not again!" the fairy fluttered 
away. Moments later, the fairy returned. 
Only this time with a lady in a silk dress. 
"Who are you?" Rebecca questioned. "You must 
stay put until your highness sees you," the 
fairy fluttered over to Rebecca, "If you move, -> 
                                        5253
   
you will return to the lion pit." Rebecca gulped. 
She was handed a sack. "Eat this in four hours 
when your highness gets here," the fair fluttered 
away, leaving a trail of dust. Four hours later, 
a lady in sweats and sneakers appeared. "You 
must eat the potato," she commanded. Rebecca 
gulped down the potato. The she fell into that 
same hole as she did before. Then, she appeared at 
the dinner table. The fairies where the toys 
Myra owned. The weird men were Joseph and 
Marc. The lady who set her free was Mother 
Helen. It was all just a day dream.
