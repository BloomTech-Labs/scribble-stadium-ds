 I woke up. Today we were exploring a pond for 
 science class; the pond will have things like 
 worms, leeches, and bug larva. I am terrified of worms. 
 My friends always tease me about it and show 
me pictures of them. I really want to stay 
home. Sundenly I get a great idea, I will 
 pretened I am sick. My parents are not up yet 
 so I boil hot water and soak a washcloth 
 in it. Then i put it on my forhead so it 
 feels hot. I hear footsteps in the hallway. My 
  mom appears in my room."I dont feel well," 
I mumble, "Ok," my mom said, "Let me check 
your temperature." "Wow you have a feaver." In my 
 head I was terrifed I would get caaght, 
 but I said "Can I stay home from school?" 
 I slept the whole day. Later after my 
 siblings got home I told my mom what 
 happened; she got very mad at me and 
 I got grounded. The next day at school:
