Jack, the middle school student, just opened up 
                during the sumer
a lemonade stand ^. The only talking pig family 
in the world, Peppa pig's next door hated lemonade 
and [] if they got cl[]se to it, they would 
get sick because the main disadvantage 
of being a talking pig is you are allergic to lemons. 
So. peppa pig went up to the lemonade stand 
and asked "Hey, got any grapes, because 
otherwise leave!" She really liked grapes. 
He said "No, I don't have grapes and I'm not 
leaving but I'll give you fresh lemonade." 
Soshe walked home and told her parents, so they 
devised a plan The very next day 
she came with the same statement an[] 
he had the same response, So after 
1 full week of doing this he finally said 
"Okay, come with me to the super market 
to buy some grapes. So when they got there 
they got out and bought grapes and then 
Peppa took them, looking at them for aninde[]
 and then at all of them in one gulp 
because she really liked grapes. [] Meanwhile, 
peppa's parents and brother and their 
godfather and god mother Princess Leia 
 and Darth Vader went to the stand with 
 haz mat suits and destroyed it. 
                                  -5202
Then, when peppa Pig got back Jlack did not   
 know Peppa's parents were involved so 
  he thought is was a bad neighborhood 
      packed and 
so he ran away and never came back. 
 The End
