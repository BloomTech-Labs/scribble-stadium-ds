Once upon a time, two friend, Jeff and 
Steve, were walking home from school. 
"See you tommorow!" Jeff yelled. as Steve 
crossed the street in the direction 
of his house. "Bye!" Seve yelled.

Steve walked into his house, and 
 noticed that his dog wasn't there. 
 Usually she would come greet him, 
 but this time, Steve was alone 
 in the doorway. His dad was 
 sleeping. So he didn't know what 
 happened. As he walked into 
 his room, He saw a note that 
 read "I have your dog and your Mother 
 captive. If you go into your mother's 
 room and open the safe (code 5921), you 
 will see why I have taken them. I want 
 $90,000 by tommorow. or your funeral 
 will have no body." Steve Stopped 
 there. He went into the bedroom and 
 opened the safe. It read that 
 his dog was the only dog of 
 its species, and that it costed 
  more than $ 3,000,000,000 to 
  get.
