     The Avocado Dillema 
      []
The two pandas Perry and Penny, lost all of 
of their avocados. 
   "You ate them all!" yelled Perry. 
   "No, I didn't," Penny responded, "because you ate 
them all!" 
   "No I didn't!" Perry oinked. 
   "Did to!" Penny responded. 
   "I couldn't have stolen them if you 
ate them all" Perry shot back. 
   "I Did NOT!" Penny responded. 
   "Then who did?" Perry asked. 
   "You," Penny pointed at Perry. 
   "I'm going to go ask Callie," Perry 
said. 
   "Me too!" Penny followed behind 
   When Perry and Penny got to Callie. 
She was talking with Harry the horse 
   "Hi Perry," said Callie, the cow. 
   "Hi Penny." said Harry 
   "Callie." Penny said. 
   "We know you stole our avocados." 
Perry declared
   "How could you say that?" Callie 
asked, "Cows don't like avocados."     ⎾  ⏋

   "Oh," Perry and Penny sighed.
   "Hey?" asked Penny, "where did 
Harry go?" 
   "We'll worry about him later, 
now we can as Rocky the rooster 
and Camy the chicken." Perry said. 
   "Ok." Penny lead the way to 
Rocky and Camy. 
   "Hi Penny!" Camy said. 
   "Hi Perry!" Rocky said. 
   "Why did you steal our avocados?" 
asked Penny. 
   "We didn't steal your avocados"
Rocy said. 
   "We were too busy all week."
Camy added. 
   "Sorry." Penny and Perry left
   "Time for Harry," Penny and Perry 
went to Harry. 
   "Hey guys" said Harry.
   "Don't deny it!" Perry said
   "We know you stole our 
avocados"
   "No!" Harry said, "my hooves 
make avocados hard to eat, 
so I don't eat them."                 ⎾  ⏋

   "Maybe we could check the cameras!" 
Perry said. 
   "Yeah!" Penny said 
   So Penny and Perry looked at the videos. 
   "Oh," Perry said, "I took one each day."
   "And I took 1 each day," Penny added. 
   "And eventually we had none left!" 
Perry exclaimed.
   "I'm sorry," Penny said. 
   "Me too" said Perry
