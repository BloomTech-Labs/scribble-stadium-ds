                      named Peter, 
Once there was a boy. A boy ^ who had something very special 
about him. He could teleport to whereever he wanted to go. One 
day he went to school, and he came across Timothy, the bully of 
the school. Timothy started fighting Peter, until Peter decided to 
get out of there. He teleported. Peter didn't really know 
where he went when he teleported. But what he did know 
is that it was cold, it was snowing, and there was no sign of 
anything other than the coldness. Suddenly out of no where, 
Peter saw a big, dark shape coming toward him. He started 
running yelling "help""help!" But nobody was there to help him. 
Finally Peter stopped running. He looked behind himself, and he 
found a huge, white tiger standing over his head. He 
screamed as loud as he could, but he was too tired to run. The 
tiger set its paws on the ground once again, and he looked 
into the eyes of the scared little boy. The tiger stepped 
closer, and then started to lick the boy's face. The boy 
started to pet the tiger, and he realized that the tiger was 
harmless. They became friend's, and the tiger showed Peter his home. 
They lived with each other for five years, and the tiger protected 
his boy. The boy names his tiger Strips. Then one day the boy 
thought of his real home. He wanted to go back. But he 
couldn't just leave Strips. So he took him home with him. 
When he teleported home, he still had to face the 
bully, Timothy. But don't worry, Strips chased him 
off.⎾   ⏋
