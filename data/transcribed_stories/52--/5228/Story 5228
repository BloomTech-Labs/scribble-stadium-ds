                Jamie 
  Hello my name is Jamie and my favorite thing to do 
is sleep. My life is pretty boring. Wake up, eat, run 
around, find the big pointy tower where people ^ Ifal Tower, 
                                              say 
and sleep again. I do have one best friend his 
name is August because he was born in august.

I keep telling Jamie it's Eiffel, but that 
stuborn cat will never change. My life is just like my 
best friend except he got adopted yesterday. If I 
could speak French I would tell that family we are "brothers." 
Maybe because Jamie has brown fur? Every time someone 
walks in the adopt a dog and this poor little cat. Maybe 
If I get adopted I can find Jamie

Life is better it turns out there is a lot more in 
life than sleeping. I found the Noter Dumb and 
I have a new best friend, Mike. Mike is awesome 
and he has to have lived longest out of everyone. He 
is 19. I am 2 now my birthday was two days ago 
and life is great. I miss Jamie still

  My cat is getting restless as if I left 
 something behind or need something.

 My life was the worst life in the history of the 
 world until today. I was adopted!

I am heading out to find my friend Mike. I love 
London but Paris is the place for me. 

"Mike!"
"Sunny!" 
"August!" 
"Jamie!" 
"I cannot believe it!" Says MiKe 
"I thought I would never see you again!" 
"Surprise, meet my cat August!" 

Every Saturday after that day '(September 5, 2019)
the four always met up with each other.⎾      ⏋
