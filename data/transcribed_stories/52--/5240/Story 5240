"But! "I want to keep her!" exclaimed 
 the little boy name Fred. "No you can't!" 
 shouted his mom. "She is to much work for us." 
 his mom told him. "Yeah, then were will 
 Lilie go (dog), to the animal shelter?" 
Fred asked, desperate now. "Maybe we can find 
 somebody who will take her in." said 
Fred's mom, who really didn't want a dog. 
"Yeah but I can take care of her, I 
can help, please?" Fred was almost to tears 
 now. "You said the same thing about 
 your hamster, and look how that turned up, 
I was doing all the work. his mom exclaimed. 
I am not ready to have a pet bigger and 
 a lot more work than a hamster. The 
 hamster was my limits! yelled his mom 
  getting angry now.""How about 
 you go to school and ask people if they 
 want to take her, and maybe you might 
 see her again," suggested his mom. "Fine," 
 grumbled Fredd. The next day at school 
 Fred started asking people. It was close to the 
  end of the day, and Fred was walking 
home, somebody asked if he could have Lilie. 
He and his parents had been looking for 
 that exact breed, and Lilie was the first 
                                  5240
dog that they had found who was 
 that type of breed. So Fred gave the 
  dog to him, and they became friends.
