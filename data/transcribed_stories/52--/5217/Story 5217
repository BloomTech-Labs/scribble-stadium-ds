                  "Woof Woof!" she replied.

  " Bye Bye, Rosy!" Sandy sa^id to her dog. Rosy she 
petted her and grabbed her backpack to go to 
school. It was Monday. She got in the car at 6:45 (she 
lived 30 minutes away from her school). Around 7:15 they 
got to the school. 
"Bye Honey! See you after school!" exclaimed Carol, 
her mom. Sandy felt great at school. Her grades 
were awesome, and all the teachers loved her. 
Sandy's best friend, Emily, was the exact opposite. 
She always forgot to do homeowrk, and was 
fooling around in class; the teachers loathed her. 
Other than her Studies, Emily was a very good person
to hang out with. On Monday, 
" Hey Sandy! You ready for gym? We have to run the 
mile!" said Emily. 
"Of course! You know me! I'm never unprepared for 
anything! The last whole week I trained! I'm 
ready for this!" 
BING! The bell had run, which meant 
it was time for gym   .(THE MILE) 
Emily grabbed her gym bag and went to Sandy's 
locker. She was putting stuff away. "Come on! Let's 
go!" yelled Emily. "Yeah, let me get my 
gym bag." Sandy went to the 'Common 
Area' to get her gym bag. Nothing 
was there. "Wait, it has to be here, 
I never forget anything!"

Emily smirked. "Well I gotta go," she said 
 " I'm going to call my mom. She can see 
if I left it there." So she called, 
"Mom, is my gym bag there?" 
" Yes, Honey! [] You forgot it!" 
                       She was playing with her   
Sandy hung up immediately.^ This was dog this.
                                  morning
the first time she EVER forgot something 
she went to her Phys. Ed teacher and 
talked to her. Her gym teacher was 
completely fine with it. So Sandy 
ended up, running the mile the next 
day.
