 Once upon a time, Alex, the tabby cat and 
Grace, the golden retiver were best friends 
under the same roof and never fought. 
They would go outside together, they would 
play tug-o-war together , got wet together, 
and got love equally by their owners together. 
One day their owners, Steven and Abby, split 
up. When Grace found this out she immediately 
told Alex, "Alex! Alex!" she said, "I heard Steven and 
Abby saying they are going to split up!" 
Alex responded, "Are you sure you heard them 
right?" "100% sure!" Grace said. "They also said that 
Steven will take me and Abby will take 
you Alex!" exclaimed Grace. This shocked Alex so 
much she had to lie down for a minute! 

  The day that they split up Alex and Grace 
made a plan. They each brought two photos 
of the other owner, they would place the 
photo in the kitchen in the morning and 
one photo in their bed at night. Alex had 
figured out that where she would be 
staying wasn't far from here, where Grace 
and Steven would stay.

A few weeks later Alex and Grace's plan 
started to work! They met up at 
the park. They went for a walk and 
Alex was even on a leash! Grace said, 
"That was a long six weeks! I was starting 
to think our plan wouldn't work!" 
"You know they say a picture's worth 
1,000 words," Alex said. 

  A month later they had met up 
several more times even without the 
pets! Then before you knew it they were 
living together again!
