 One average Saturday morning, John woke up. 
 He did what he did every morning, put 
 on his clothes, walk downstairs and eat 
 breakfast. It was a sunny day 
 outside and he wanted to go to the 
  park with his dog Bailey. John asked 
his mom if they could both go to 
 the park for a while. She agreed and 
 off they went. John attatched Bailey 
 to a leash. John brought a ball and 
 a rope to play with Bailey. As they 
 aproached the park, John saw something 
  gloring in the sun in the distance. 
 It was about 100 metres away. John 
 tried to stop and look at it, but 
  Bailey kept on pulling him away. John 
 redirected Bailey to the direction of 
 the light. But Bailey did not budge. 
 It was then when John relized that 
 Bailey wanted a burger that was 
 dropped near the enterance of the park. 
 John kept on pulling but then Bailey 
 did something unusual. He sat down 
 and did a gesture to go home. It 
  was very wierd because it was

  like a human act, he knew 
  that no one would get what they wanted 
   and John understood.
