                                5234  - 
   One day, a quarrel broke out 
between a dolphin and a human over 
who was smarter. 
   "I can communicate with my peers 
 and I've taken over more than half of 
 the world," the human bragged. 
    "And you really think that's a good 
 thing?" the dolphin sneered. "First of all, you 
are currently DESTROYING the environmnet 
and ruining the land, not to mention that 
you have caused the endangerment or 
extinction of hundreds to thousands of 
 species. Also, the underwater world still 
 remains largely untouched by you. Do 
 you have a settlement down there? 
 Yeah, I didn't think so." 
   The human turned bright red in 
the face. He spluttered, "W-well, y-you, 
think you're s-so smart, but I'm s-smarter!" 
   The dolphin replied, "Then how about 
we have a contest? We'll have two judges: 
 a human and a dolphin, to be fair." 
   The human and the dolphin were now 
face-to-face. The human told the dolphin, 
" You're on." 
   The next day, the race began. the 
                                5234
judges were in position and in collaboration 
with each other, they had devised a 
series of races. 
   "The races are in this " order," the 
human judge called out to the large crowd that 
 had amassed as the news spread. 
    The dolphin judge the[] shaited, "First, the 
race on land. Then, the race in water. 
 After that, the race for food, and 
 then the race for shelter; and []finally, 
 the deciding race, the race for communication. 
 Whoeve"r[]wins three races wins!" 
    "Let's go," the dolphin and human said. 
    The horn blared for the beginning 
of the land race. The human took off, 
leaving the dolphin struggling on the 
ground. Five minutes later, the human 
crossed the finish line one kilometer away 
while the dolphin had barely gained one 
meter. 
   "The human wins! 1-0, humans!" 
The human announcer yelled, prompting huge 
applause from the humans in the crowd. 
"Now, for the waer race!" 
   The story was very much 
the opposite. the dolphin swam quickly, getting 
                                  5234
 to the finish line in a few minutes 
 while the human flailed helplessly. 
    "I don't know how to swim! he 
wailed. 
    "Aaaand, the dolphin wins the 
 water race! 1-1, tie game!" the dolphin 
 announcer announces as the dolphins cheer. 
 "[]Now, for the food race!" 
     " The rules are simple," the 
human announcer announced. "Whoever can 
 find, kill, and consume an animal first 
 will win!" 
     The horn blared, but before they 
 could start, a brave woman raced 
 out onto the track. "Wait!" she 
 yelled.
      "Why?" asked the competitors. 
      "Whot is the point of this?" 
she demanded. "We're all mammals! Why 
are we competing to see who's better?" 
    The two competitors looked at 
  each other in confusion. Then, the dolphin 
  said sheepishly, "Er... we don't really 
  know." 
       "Then stop this nonsense!" The 
 woman yelled. "You're just wasting energy!" 
                                     5234
    "Ymm.. okay," they said, 
 shaking hands. The crowd roared 
 with approval. The races were called 
 off, and they walked back, to their 
 respective homes, the dolphin told the 
 human, " Well, there's one advantage, 
 you have over me." 
       "What?" the human asked. 
       "Well, I don't have opposable 
 thumbs. Or hands, for that matter." 
       They smiled and walked off 
into the sunset.
