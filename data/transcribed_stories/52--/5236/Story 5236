     Lynda's Part of the Story
  Hello. my name is Lynda and I live a very unusual 
life. My family is gone, I was alone, and I'm a 
wereworld. Let me tell you my story. 
  It was a dark windy night with my family 
in our hut. It was just another gloomy 
night. I was hungry, so I left our hut 
 to get some berries. When I came back 
 a nightmare came to life. 
   I was watching my family of werewolves 
getting kidnapped by humans. They weren't 
killed. however they were getting pushed into a 
 truck. The last thing I remember was my 
 mom mouthing the words run. The humans 
 turned my way. That was the fastest I 
 had ever run in my life. 

      Mark's part of the story 
   Hi, [] my name is Mark. I 
am a hunter of all the werewolves. This may 
sound cruel but let me tell you my story. 
   I was just a kid at the time but my parents 
were away on a business trip. I was with my 
 grandma who I loved dearly. One day I found 
                  on the porch 
 my grandma crying ^ and asked her what 
 was wrong. She looked surprised to see me there 
 but reluctantly said, "Your parents are gone." 
                                        5236
 For a while that never registered with me 
but when I finally understood I became 
curious. What happened on the night of their 
death? One day I found the courage to 
ask. My grandma never hid anything from me 
but she did this once. She only said one 
word to me, "Werewolves." That was the 
day I decided all werewolves had to die. 
 None should be forgiven. 

     Lynda's Part 
  I settled down and started weeping. 
How could this happen. I stayed there for 
a while when someone picked me up. They 
 took me into their house where I continued 
 weeping. I didn't know what was happening 
 all I knew was that they were a human. 
 I continued to scratch untill they gave 
 me a pill I fell asleep within seconds. 

     Mark's Part
   I became a hunter of all wolves. The 
dangerous and the small. Not a single one 
could be innocent. They all were bad is 
what I told myself. I then [] went 
home to hear crying upstairs. I didn't 
                               5236
     []
 have ^ [] little sibling. I wondered 
who this was. 

    Lynda's part 
   I woke up from my slumber to an old 
lady smiling at me. I started scratching 
at her but she held me tight. "Calm 
 down," is what she said. I started to 
 trust her. 

    Mark's Part 
   I went upstairs into my house and 
 saw no one. Not even my grandma but 
 the noise had stopped. One thing I 
 noticed however is that their was 
 a ladder leading up to the ceiling. I 
 climbed up to a terrifying sight. 

     Afterwards I s 
   Mark went up and saw his Grandmother 
cradling a small Werewolf. I freaked 
out. "Grandmother what are you doing?!?" 
I talked with them both and found out 
not all werewolves are bad. Some are 
good like this poor one. []

   [] [] Ending                 5236
  Now Lynda and Mark are married. 
The Grandmother helps them take care 
of their hybrid child Stella. They 
all love each other.[][] The 
world went to peace between people 
and werewolves.
