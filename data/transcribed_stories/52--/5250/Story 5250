    It was [] hot[] summer evening, 
  and I was sitting at my desk, staring 
 at my dead fish at the very bottom of the 
tank. I sat there, licking my popsicle and 
thought about getting another fish to replace 
[] this one. But before I asked my parents 
 for another one, I thought to myself, This 
 would be my 6th fish. Do you really want 
 another one?
    My parents only allow me to have a fish or 
a small bird. That's it. But what I really 
long for is a [] bigger pet, like a dog or cat. 
For three years, my two brothers and I are always 
asking for a pet other than just a fish 
or frog. We even put together a seven paged 
perssuasive essay! Every year for my birthday, I 
always ask for a different pet.[] My birthday 
 is just two weeks away, but I don't 
 think I'll be getting one no matter how 
 much I ask. My parents think that it's 
 such a big responsibility to take care of 
 a pet like a dog. But at least I'm 
 not longing for something so crazy 
 like my brothers. Their strongest 
 desire is to have a pet crocodile! 
 I know that they will never get one. 
 And that is a fact.                   1

   I just can't wait until I finally 
get my own dog, cat, goat, whatever 
it might be. I [] sat there, sucking 
on my bright blue popsicle, [] pondering. 
Half an hour passed, and [] suddenly, 
I had an epiphony. "I got it!" I 
[] hollered. My brothers came racing 
into the room. "The plan?" Jamie asked 
with a huge grin. Jamie is [] the oldest 
brother. He's a sophmore in high school 
and is 16.
      "Yes," I replied. 
      "Well, come on! The sooner [] you 
[] share it, the soon we can get it!" 
exclaimed my other brother Carson. 
Carson is in Eight Grade. He's 14. 
    [] Reader, you are probably thinking: 
what could this plan be? [] Since 
last year, we've been planning a 
way to get our pet. 
    "Ok, here it is: starting tomorrow 
 morning, at 8:00 a.m., we are telling 
[] Mom that we're meeting Jake 
in 
^[] the woods to explore the earth. []

And then we're-"
    "Wait, hold on. Exploring bugs? That's 
ridiculous.
