One day the Sun came up. Sun 
was a very stoic and happy feeling. 
 Sun represented light when it 
was dark or as some people 
would say a nice day when Sun 
shined. It was 9:00 in the 
morning and Moon rose. "It is 
not time for you to rise and take 
over the Sky!" declared Sun. "I do 
not get enough time in the Sky! 
You always get all of the [] 
attention and the only time I am 
recognized is when I am full 
and the only reason people 
notice that is because I can 
make ware wolves appear!". 
"Wind who do you think should 
have more time in the 
Sky?" asked Sun. "Maybe moon 
so more people can sleep longer", 
said Wind. After wind made 
his statement there was a big 
woosh. "Tally mark for me!" Moon 
[]  exclaimed. "He clouds who 
do you think should be in the 
sky longer?" asked Moon.

"I think taht the Sun should 
be out for longer because 
then kids can play outside lon-
ger." said clouds. "Maybe we 
can share the time we get in 
the Sky", said Sun. "Okay", said 
Moon. They lived happily ever 
after
