   "Help! Help!" a voice shouted from beyon the 
canyon. I was puzzled if I should investigate 
at such a time. Before my mother passed 
she told me to always use my best judgment. 
But I wanted to help whomever 
was calling in such terror. I lept up 
from my ditch and carfully crept to 
where the screaming was coming from. 
   "Help! Please!" screamed the girl. She was 
trapped under a bolder. I quickly found a 
large stick and lifed the rock as much 
as I could to open it. She lept 
out. She was Covered in bruises and cuts 
but the first thing I noticed was that 
she was human. What was she doing on our 
side? 
   "Thank you so much, you saved my life!" 
she hugged me and ran across the 
canyon and into the deep forest, Should 
I have helped her? What would my 
father think? I decided to walk home 
and tell my sister floral. 
     *     *      * 

    As I got ready for dinner Father 
 walked into my room.

  "What Kind of ELf helps a human!?!" 
he towered over my stick skinny body. 
  "How did you know? I asked. Did 
floral tell him? 

   "A offical saw you Vine! You are a 
disgrace to all elves! In a war like this... 
..  You're grounded, cant come to dinner!" 

As bad as this may seem I want 
you to know he always spoke to 
me as this. And he always forgets. By 
next dinner he had forgoton the entire 
thing. 

And I got to meet the girl again. 
Her name is Maya. 

   "Hi, Im Maya. I was the girl who you 
saved! Thank you again!" 

  She was very energetic. We ended up 
becoming good friends after the war 
ended three excutiating years after this. 
I am actually glad I saved her. Even 
though she is human and I am an Elf.
