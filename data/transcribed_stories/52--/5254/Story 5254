      A Star Wars Story    - 5254
☆        The Clone Wars 
   Commandere Cragg was worried. His team had 
crashed into a bog on planet Denegar, and 
they seemed to be stuck. 
    He walked over to his trusted aide, 
Captain Zev. "Any news?" he asked.
    "No."
    The clones walked toward their smoking 
 escape pod. The charred husk of the pod reminded 
  the two of their dead brothers. Then the pod 
 carrying the clones had landed, only two 
 clones had made it out of the ill-fated 
 vessel. 
     Those two were Cragg and zev.

     "RUN!" Cragg shouted. He pushed his 
   men through a corridor as droids started 
 to pour in. He returned their fire until 
 forced to retreat. "Go!" 
     The clone [] divison - Reek, Seven, Ate, and 
 Deviss - ran. Cragg laid down covering fire until[]
it became too late. He sprinted with 
 his men. 
     They couldn't possibly know, but their 
 starship was about to blow.

  Outside, the droid ship Malevolence waited. 
On boar[] stood General Grievious. His skeletal, 
 imposing frame seemed to take up the 
 whole ship, and his rasping breath hinted 
 at a great evil within. 
        This was darkness. 
       Grievious ordered the ion cannons 
 to fire. They immediately knocked out 
 every single power[] source on the republic 
 ship. 
       The ship was doomed. 
       As the power cut off on the ship, 
 Cragg sighed. He hated to do this, but it 
 was clear it was the only way. 
       "Abandon ship," he said. 
       They sprinted to the escape 
pods. 
       As they got there, they saw 
that the power there was out too. 
The only way to launch it was a 
manual lever - that had to be yanked 
by someone outside th pod. 
       Cragg resigned himself to his fate. 
"I'll do it," he said grimly ⎾                      ⏋

       Cragg scowled under his helmet. 
       "I'm commander here!" 
       "Which is why you [] can' die!" retorted Ate.
       Cragg shook his head. "Let me do this, soldier.
       You must go on for the Republic."
       At nodded, resignedly. 
       As Crass prepared to launch the leverl, the clones got in, 
                                    - 5254 pg 3 
       [] Cragg started to push the lever - he never 
    got the chance.  
          Ate knocked him out with 2 well-
placed punch. 
          Ate sighed. "Get him in." Seven and Deviss 
 hauled him in. Captain Zev noaded with respect. 
          "Good luck." 
          The pod fell away.

          As the clones wandered around, a 
spaceship crashed next to them. Out 
 of it climbed a bunch of clones. Upon seeing 
 Cragg and Zev, one yelped and fell back. 
"Control yourself, Nolife," A Jedi stepped out. 
 He noticed Cragg immediately. "Commander 
 Cragg, I take it? Master Senesca, 4th Battalion. 
 Cragg snapped to attention. "Commander Cragg, 
 Regiment 7. It's an honor, Master Jedi." 
          The clones moved on.
          Cragg marched in front of the 
          candioates.

    "Hup! Let's get to it!" 
    He pointed at a clone. 
    "What's your name?" 
    The clone saluted. 
    "No Life, sir!"
                                  5254 pg 4
    He continued this process.
    He discovered that his new team 
 consisted of: 
       - No-life, Sergeant
       - Beetle, trooper 
       - O, trooper 
       - Lee, trooper 
    He wrote it all down and moved on. 

    Suddenly, a crash came through the 
  woods. Master Senesca ignited his forest 
 green lightsaber. 
    "They've found us," he said grimly. 
           The battle was epigc.
  The droids danced around the clones 
 but they fought them off. They 
 blew up droid after draid, blowing 
 them up for their fallen brothers. 
 As No-Life and Captain Zev blew up, 
 they only fought harder. 
      ZRM! The Jedi's light Saber 
    hummed. 
      PRW! The commander's gun []blasted.
      Finally, they had won.
