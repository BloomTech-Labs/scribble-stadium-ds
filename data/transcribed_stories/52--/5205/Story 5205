April Mically was the most popular girl in 
school. Her school life was amazing but 
her home life was not so good. 
April family is really poor. They barly have 
enough money for a house let alone a 
tv or phone. April made the best 
of it but sometimes she would come 
home crying because her friends got a 
new phone, or a designer bag, or a new 
dress. Her mom always comed her down 
and she was Ok again. 

Summer on the other hand was rich. 
She was not very popular though. Her best 
friend was her dog, Luna. Summer had 
everything. A huge house, like a million dresses, 
the newest iphone, but she didn't have 
friends. 

Over time Summer and April became 
good friends. Summer lended April some 
money when she was in need and April 
let Summer hang out in her friend 
group. 

One day Summer and April pranked 
                          5205
the teach and put thumb tacks on 
the chair. Soon the teachers figured 
it out though and they got into 
trouble. 
"It's your fault April," Summer sobbed, "thanks 
to you our parents are going to 
be here any moment now!" 
"Look, I didn't Know they had secerity 
cameras here. I'm sorry!" April sobbed back. 

A few moments later both sets of 
parents walked in. You could obuisly tell 
who was who. After a long talk with the 
princible they were told they needed to 
clean the attic. 

Summer was so mad at April that they 
seperated onto completely different sides. 
Then a huge flash came from the 
side April was on. Summer came running 
over. Suddenly a strong muscular man stood 
before them. He said, "I am a genie. I 
am here to grant you three wishes. 

April got so excited she made 2 wishes 
right there and then. She wished 
                               5205
"I want 1 million dollars and the 
newest iphone." 
"Be careful" warned Summer, "there is always 
a dark side to the wishes." 

April didn't listen and soon found out 
it was bad. She found out that she 
turned evil and never trusted a 
genie again. She appologyed to Summer 
and said the she was right. "I will 
never be tray you again."
