  William Tell sat, staring blankly at his target, 
  the apple on his son's head. He readied his 
  arrow and aimed at his son, Henry. The tree 
  behind Henry blurted out, "Don't shoot me, 
  you idiot!" "Well why shouldn't I," William 
  shouted. "Because who would shoot at thier son, 
  anyway!" "You make a point ... but I am 
  practicing archery, and I, William Tell, am 
  the best archer in the entire world. "The tree 
  argued, "You'd also be shooting me." William 
  interrupted, "Why should I care, anyway?" "Because 
  then the gaurdians would come after you," the 
  tree stated. "What? they don't even exist." "Really? 
  Seriously? Don't be an idiot. Gaurdians are real. You 
  haven't seen them?" the tree asked. William stated, 
 "Nope." The tree asked, "No! Not the big tall tree 
 Statues? they have arms, legs and faces? They 
  do exist!" "I don't believe you," said William. "Fine, then," 
  the tree said, "shoot." William shot the tree. 
   When he was leaving the forest, he met the 
 gaurdians for the first and last time, perhaps 
 he, the best archer in the world, would never 
 meet anyone again.
