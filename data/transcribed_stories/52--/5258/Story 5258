  Once in a land far away lived 
   Jim an ordanary kid and draggo 
  a shape shifting dragon. 
 "How did you do that?" asked Jim 
 Draggo replied, " I just thought of 
 a dog and then I turned into 
 one." "I wish that I could do 
 stuff like that." said Jim 
  "Well I will die if a touch water,"
wispered Draggo into Jim's ear. 
" I never knew that!" shouted Jim. 
  Right as he said that a 
  troll came out from under 
  the bridge. "If you want 
 this pretty boy back cross the 
 lake!" said the troll picking up Jim. 
 Draggo said in a sad tone, "I will die 
 if I get in!" "Too bad!" said 
  the troll. Draggo had an idea. 
  It was riskey but it might work. 
 With that draggo shape shifted 
  into a human! When he touched 
                             e 
  the water he did not die th^[]n 
  a shark tried to eat him. 
  So draggo turned into a 
 shark and crossed the river. The 
 shark that almost at Draggo did not 
                                5258
 notice. Then draggo turned back 
  into his god like state. 
   The troll releases Jim. The end
