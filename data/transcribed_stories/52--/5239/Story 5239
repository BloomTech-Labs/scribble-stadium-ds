I found you outside my house, in my yard, one wing 
bent, with some feathers missing. A soft coo emitted 
from your throat, and pity welled inside of me. 
"Don't worry," I told you. "I'm here," I said. I 
cupped you in my hands. You were my treasure. 
I nursed you and fed you, and gave you a home. 
You were my best friends. I Knew you had to go 
 someday, but I brushed that thought aside. 
 "Surely you will always be with me," I thought. 
 "You are my only true friend." You were with 
 me for the good times, and the bad times. You 
 grew bigger and healthier, and I knew it was 
 almost time to realse you from your cage. 
 I loved you so much, it hurt to think of you 
 leaving. I felt conflicted. I wanted you to be 
 free, but my greed and selfishness pinned me 
 down. "I love you," I would whisper. But saying 
 that only made me sadder. Selfishness is some-
 thing all humans possess. I could not help it. 
 But eventually, I Knew the day had come. 
 I had to let you go. I took your cage to 
 my yard. The place where I found you. 
 "You will always be my very, very best friend," 
 I whispered. "I will always be by your side." 
 Then, with one small movement of my hand, 
 you were set free. You flew away my treasure, a 
 free, healthy bird.
