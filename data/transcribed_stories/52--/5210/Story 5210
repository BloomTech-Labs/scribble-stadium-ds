                     named Timothy Browns
There once was a boy ^ who lived in a cottage 
in a large forest. One day he told his mother, "I'm going 
to take a walk in the forest. "Yes, you may do as 
you wish," his mother replied. Timothy wondered what he would 
come by on this adventure. As he strolled through the forest 
Timothy found something he never noticed. A large cave 
sat in the side of a boulder. Timothy, being a curious 
wanderer, ventured into the mysterious new cave After 
walking around for a minute or two, Timothy came uon a 
small cavern crowded by rocks on the ground. But there 
was something else about this cavern. A blue glow was 
coming from . the walls and floating around the room. 
It was bonding to the rocks and made them 
seem like they were hovering off the ground. Timothy 
wanted to see what this magical force was doing.So 
he got on his knees and picked up one of the 
rocks. It felt lighter than most rocks. Suddenly, 
The rock flew out of timothy's hand and hit 
  an other rock. Then like a tornado all the rocks spun 
around and all cane together. When the dust settled, 
in front of Timothy was a rock figure. With blue 
 glowing eyes and two small rock ears. He said, "Hi, I am" 
then it paused and said, "I don't have a name." Timothy 
marvled at the new creaure he had discovered. "Woah." 
They becane friends but Timothy couldn't think 
 of a name eventually he naned him Rocky.
