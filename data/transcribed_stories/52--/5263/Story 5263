The story of Mr. Fox         -  5263
One sunny evening in a forest there was 
a wolf and a Fox, the wolf's name was 
Holz, and the Fox's name was just Mr. Fox. 
They were best friends for very long until 
last year where Holz made Mr. Fox leave 
school with him and go to forests to hunt. 
Later on, Holz just bossed Mr. Fox around, 
Mr. Fox never complained or said anything 
to make Holz stop, but today, this evening, 
he will make Holz pay for what he 
did...
     Holz and Mr. Fox were ready to go to 
dinner, they were right next to a barn. 
"Check if there are anyone," Holz told Mr. Fox. 
He just answered with a nod and ran into 
the barn. The animals were locked inside 
a big barn house, luckily, there was 
a small hole to enter the house. After 
Mr. Fox went in, he was so excited. The 
barn was filled with sheeps and no 
human. 
"All checked," yelled Mr. Fox, "come here!" 
     Holze ran there as fast as he could 
and was impressed. They didn't talk at all 
and started eating. Every few seconds, 
Mr. Fox went throw the hole and check out-
side and came back. There and back, there 
                                    5263
and back. 
   Holz was curious so he asked, "what are 
 you doing?" 
  Mr. Fox answered, "I... um... am just checking if 
anyone was here." 
   Suddenly, A human came from the back door 
carrying a Moisin Nagat and a cane. Mr. Fox 
zipped throw the hole as fast as he could, 
but Holz was stucked at the hole because he 
ate way to much! That is when Holz realized 
that everytime when Mr. Fox went threw the 
door, he was trying to figure out how much 
to each more. The human shot Holz and died. 
Mr. Fox was more than happy. He was finally free...
