 It was themiddle of july. 
Bob's Avalon fight was today. It was 
the Games of the papwalls and the 
riptied Lions. Bob was one of the 
fiecest papwhals. Papwhals are 
a mix of puppies, pizzlies, bats, and 
narWhals. Bob was sure he wasgoing 
to win it for his team and 
take over the jungle. But, there were 
two creatures that were standing 
in his way. The first one was the 
Demon King that tries to kill you 
when you pass the half way mark. 
The other one are the Lionis, Lionis Riptide. 
Lionis was a little older than Bob. The 
 reason he hate Lionis is because when 
 Bob was younger his mom went out to 
hunt. But at that time the papwhals 
and the Riptide Lions had piece but 
then, "Ahh!!" Bob's fathe'r ranout 
 and she was gone. Bod had seen a Riptide 
Lion speeding away. Bod though ist was 
Lionis so ever since then he wanted 
to kill Lionis. Now he just live with 
his father Tidus. So he is training. 
                                          5225
Then he saw Lionis and his team. 
Lionis said, "Hello Bob." Bod replided "Hey... Bad" 
"So, did you train for the bigboy games?" 
Said Lionis "Ha of coarse I did." "OK then 
 best of luck to you." "Same to you." 
 Then came flying in from the sky, 
 a very pretty papwhal.
