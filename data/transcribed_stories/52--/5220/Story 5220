"You must do it. You must track down the 
giant."
   That was my father's last words to 
me, before I was kicked out of the palace, 
into the outside wilderness. Let me 
explain. My name is Tony Kane, and 
my Father is the King of Astenia. 
 We had been arguing over if I should 
 go out to find the famous giant, Sleth. 
 We have never captured him before, and 
 naturally my father wanted him. 
 He told me that I should capture Sleth, 
 to prove to the Astenians that I should 
 become the king after he would die. 
I, on the other hand, did not want this, 
 but my father did not care. At all. 
  Now I was feeling I had been abandoned 
  to get a silly prize my father wanted to 
  brag about. I hated it. But now, I felt 
 an anser; one that filled up with a 
 desire to capture Sleth, and to prove 
 to my father that I was better than 
being abandoned. But I decided that I 
 Should prove my worth to the Asterians 
 by helping them with their own 
 problems. After all, Sleth was not 
  bothering them. []

 So, for the next ten years, my father 
 didn't hear a single word from me. 
  I kept on helping each Asterian, 
 going from door to door, day and night. 
I helped each family out with their 
 biggest struggle, in exchange for 
 a promise: don't tell the king anything. 
 After the ten years, I came back 
 to the palace, to the same door that 
 I had gotten kicked out from. 
 I knocked on the door, and 2 seconds 
  later, a guard came. When he saw 
  me, he stared. Slowly, his eyes widened 
  when he realized who was standing 
  there. He called for the king to 
  come, and all of a sudden, I saw 
 my father but in a different way from 
 10 years ago. His hair was turning 
 gray, he had more wrinkles. But I 
 didn't care. Despite all of the 
 resentment from 10 years ago, I hugged 
  him with all my might. I still loved 
  him, even if he had kicked me out. 
  He was right, though. I did need 
  the Astenians respect, and by those 
   10 years, I think I earned theirs. 
   But my father's response was not []

 what I thought it would be. 
 "Where's Sleth?" he asked. 
 Apparently he didn't care if I 
  was here or not. But when I 
  explained what had happened, his 
  scowl at the beginning of my 
  explination slowly turned into a 
   chuckle at the end. 
     "I'm amazed. You earned the 
 Astenians respect, like I told you 
 too," he said. "Even though you 
 did not capture Sleth, you still have 
 my respect. You did a great job." 
   I stood there, so happy I was 
   paralyzed. I had did it. I had earned 
   my father's respect.
