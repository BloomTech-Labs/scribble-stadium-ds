          Conflict             5215
    I threw up. The water smashed 
up against our carrier. "How could you 
do it!" Sam said. "I had too!" I replied.
I held my rifle closer. "How was I 
sapposed to know your a shapeshifter 
from another planet?" I said. "I told you. 
Now we are on a landing craft 
heading for Normandy to defeat the 
Germans and you still can't make 
things right." It was June 6, 1944, 
D-Day. An explosion happened. I looked 
towards Omahah beach. Soldiers were 
rushing the sandy beaches and 
firing their rifles. I looked at Sam. 
"We don't have time for this." 
He grabbed my shoulder. His brown hair 
was flying every which way from 
the wind." You told your government 
about me." I looked to our commander. 
"30 seconds!" he shouted." Alang with 
 that you havn't given me any 
 respect," Sam grawled. I' heard a 
 thump, we hit the beach. The 
front went down and the shooting 
 started. I rushed out and didn't 
 look back. Men were screaming as they
  hit the ground with no life left.

  I made it to the wall. Sam 
 made it to. I heard a German shout 
 something I couldn't understand. 
 Suddenly a German Soldier 
 appeared out of the doorway 
  we rushed through and aimed a 
 pistol at same. I quickly aimed 
 my rifle and shot. I had never 
  shot a gun before. Sam hugged 
 me. "You... You saved me," he said
 in a shaky voice." Anything for 
 my friend," He smiled. "I will cover you 
 rush that tunnel over there.," he 
 pointed to a tunnel about ten
  feet away from us. It was made 
 out of wood which surprized me 
 because most tunnels were made 
 out of stone. He got on top of a 
 50 caliber machine gun turret and started 
 laying down fire on the enemy 
 dougout. I rushed for the wooden 
 tunnel. I heard a click sound. I 
 stopped dead. I looked around and 
 saw nothing. I heard an explosion and 
  then everything went black. I 
 awoke with Sam dragging me to a 
  medic station. "Sam! You saved me."

  I said weakly. "Anything for 
 a friend," he said. He started 
  laughing. I smiled and started 
  laughing. I stood up. I heard 
 a huge cheer and my commander 
 shout, "We did it boys!" Sam looked at 
 me and smiled, "Time to take Berlin."
