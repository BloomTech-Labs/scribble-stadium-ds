The date ws April 24, 2047 at the planet 
 known as Mars. Leo is a martian and his best friend 
 is Max. They are the leader of the Martians. 
Mars is getting attacked by the dreadful 
Earthlings and are losing. Leo says, "We must 
flee to Neptune. All our people will die." 
The people all chant 13000 and are not 
 moving anywhere. Max says, "We cannot move. 
 If the people do not like it, we probally 
 cannot dissuade them to." One half an hour 
 later, the Earthlings came storming into the 
 Town Hall and said "Give us all your valuables 
 or we will destroy everything." At that moment 
 the people and Max realized what Leo was 
  talking about and said, "We have to go! Get 
  in the escape pods and go!" The Earthlings 
  chased the martians all the way to Jupiter, 
  and since Jupieter is a gas, the hid inside 
  the very dense gas, and while the Earthlings 
  were celebrating thinking that the Martians 
  had died, the Martians snuck out and lived 
  on Neptune.
