One day, some where in the 
middle of space, was a 
coloney of aliens. They were 
very much like humans, as they 
spoke the same language. The 
coloney had a King and queen 
alien, like most other colonies. The 
King and Queen also had to 
children, Luna and Lucy. They 
acted like normal kids do except 
they're aliens. One day, they 
were debating where to go on 
vacation. Their parents told them 
to deside where to travel next. 
Luna said, "I want to go to 
Mars!" Lucy returned, "No! The humans 
will see us there! They have so 
much high-tech rovers and stuff!" 
"Fine, where do you want to 
go?" "I think it would be pleasent 
  to go to Saturn." "Why? We 
  can't even stand on it! It's made 
  of gas and stuff." They ' needed to 
  deside soon. Suddenly, "Hey Lucy! I 
 have an idea!" 
                             5204
 "What's your idea?" " How about 
 we go to Neptune, since we 
 pass Saturn along the way and 
 the humans wont see us!" "Great 
 idea!" So later that day, the went 
 to their parents, "Mommy, daddy," 
 said Luna, "we've desided where 
 to go!" said Lucy. "Where?" They 
 asked. "Neptune!" the said in unisen. 
 "fun!" said the queen. Two weeks 
 later' they were there.
