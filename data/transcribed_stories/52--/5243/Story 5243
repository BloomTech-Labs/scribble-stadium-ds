      Fast Feet           5243  -
Hi, I'm Bob. My best friend's Zip. 
   We usually walk to school together. 
 Zip is a fast robot. He is the fastest thing 
  in our school, PS. 39. When we 
 walk to school he walks really fast. 
 Since I'm slow I cannot keep up very 
 well. []
   One day I ask, "Zip, can 
  you walk any slower?"
   "No," he says in a robotic way. 
   "You're so selfish!" I yell. He runs 
   away. That was our first fight. 
I was churlish. I wasn't kind. 
  I started to cry. He was my only 
friend. The next day he didn't come 
 to walk with me. I saw him with 
 J. C. Adamson. I was mad. This 
 time I learned what I have 
  to keep my cool. I didn't 
  yell. 
    At school I sat down next 
  to him. 
    "Zip," I said "I'm so sorry!" 
  "Robots have fellings, Bob," Zip replied. 
  "Is J. C. Adamson nice?" I asked
  "Yes, he said he's always wanted to 
  be your friend!" said Zip 
                                  5243-
 " Thanks Zip," I replied. 
  "Remember to treat everyone and everything 
  the same, Bob!"
