One day two friends were planning to watch a movie, 
Rick the friendly ghost, and Gavin the human boy. 
Rick said, "We should watch Ghostbusters because we 
would see people of my kind," but Gavin said "Nah, 
let's watch Star Wars." The two friends different 
choices so they started arguing, "We should watch 
Ghostbusters!" said Rick "No, Star Wars is much 
better." They argued for a few minutes then Rick 
said, "That's it I'm going home" "Fine with me." 
Gavin replied, so Rick left and went home but 
both of them knew that they didn't want to 
leave so later that day Gavin went over to Rick's 
house and rang the doorbell but nobody answered so 
he rang it again but no one answered. he tried one 
 more time but then his mom answered. "Yes?" she said 
 "Uh is Rick hom?" Gavin asked, "No I'm sorry." 
 Gavin decided to go to the place that Rick goes to 
  a lot... The Park! Gavin. went to the park 
 and Rick was there sitting by himself so Gavin 
 went and sat next to him and said "Look, I'm 
 sorry about earlier," It's all good le's go and decide 
 on a movie," Rick replied. "Yah, that would be 
 Fun." So they went back and decided to watch 
 Spiderman.
