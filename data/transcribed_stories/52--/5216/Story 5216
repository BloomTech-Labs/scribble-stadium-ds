         
 Bob was skiing super fast trying to beat 
  his opponent, a cute dog. Even though the 
dog was cute, they were still enemies. 
 They had been racing their whole lives 
 and now they were tied in championships won. 
 Bob taunted, "You're gonna' lose you're gonna' 
 lose." The dog's name was Boo who was 
 the world's best dog skier. Boo wasn't any 
 dog, he was a talking dog. "You are 
  going to lose actually and when I win
 I'm going to hold the trophy in your face," 
 said Boo. They were now on the finally 
 stretch, Boo just behind Bob. They would 
  have to jump through a ring of fire. 
 The finish line wasn't far ahead. 
 Everyone's hearts were beating very 
  fast. Bob is first. He trips! Boo 
  catches up. And the race is 
 over! The judges aren't sure who won. 
 They checked the replay. Boo won by 0.001 
                                 5216 
 Seconds. Bob throws his skis and poles
 His break and he starts crying, "I... I 
 can't ba-ba-believe I lost to a dog."
