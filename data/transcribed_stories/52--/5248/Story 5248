  "Hey Ruby! Emerald! Pearl! I shouted, waveing a 
hand to my friends, all waiting for me in the court 
yard of our school, the Acadamy of Mytical Arts. 
   "Opal. You're late." 
   "Cheerful as ever, Ruby." I grinned. Ruby had, by 
FAR, the largest temper in our group. 
   "HURRY UP!"
   "Fine!" I flew to my locker, floating in 
 its usuall spot amoug all of the other crystal 
 lockers. I quirkly unpacked my sparkly white 
 bag, then adgusted my uniform. 
   "Hey, can we stop by the cafiteria?" I asked, 
flying twards them. 
   "Really, Qpak? Oversleeping AGAIN?" 
   "You know me to well." Emerald was my 
best friend, and was also the most "proper" 
of us all. 
    "I think that she should sleep." Protested 
Pearl, the most kind hearted of all of us 
    "Well, trubles aside, I NEED TO DO 
THE HOMEWORK!" Ruby screeched, frantic 
as usuall 
    "Wait- You didn't to your home work? We 
thought you did!" I protested. 
   "I know! But like, HElP!!" 
                                    5248  -

   "OK, OK. We'll help." Emerald was calm, as 
always. 
   "Is it hard?" 
   "No, you just have to do some reserch on 
Earthlings and answer the work sheet." I respon[] 
trying to save my hea[]ing.
   "Ok, let's do this!" Cheered Pearld, sweetly. 
   "So, Who was the first President of 
 the American i states?" 
   "Um, George something?" 
   "Gorge Washington." 
   "Close enough!" 
   And just like that, We helped conplete the 
home work that was issued 3 DAYS ago in 
15 minutes.
