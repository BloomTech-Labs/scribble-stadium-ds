  "Ow! That hurt," exclaimed Billy. 
  "What are you going to do about it," said Michael. 
  "I don't know but you punched me hard." 
  "Oh well, I guess next time [] you should get 
 out of the way." 
   Billy walked that evening and thought of 
 a way to stop Michael from hurting him. At 
 night, Billy took a piece of paper and started 
 writing a plan. He thought it was going 
 to be the best plan ever created. 
   The next morning[] he walked over to 
 his best friend Ted, and he lshowed him the plan. 
 "I don't think that [] you should do this," said 
 Ted, "It seems very bad." 
   Billy took time that night and decided he was 
 going to settle it verbaly. The next morning 
 [] he walked up to Michael and said that they 
 should settle things. 
   [] "How do you want to settle things?" said Michael 
   "If you stop hurting me then you will be 
 more likeable." 
      []
   "Ok, I'll stop hurthing you."
