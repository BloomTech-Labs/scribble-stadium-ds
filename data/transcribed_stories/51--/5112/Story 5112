     having as much fun as them, Ronald, 
      was being bullied by multiple people, 
               shy and akward
because he was [] he was very short for 8th grade
                   standing at 4"3, James felt very 
                 bad for Ronald but he knew he 
         would just end up in the doctors office 
            with stitches, then, he saw sophie, 
            go up and stand up for Ronald. It 
              worked! The bullies backed down!

              bullied again, and Sophie was out sick! so

              to the bullies, he walked over and 
                 stood in front of Ronald with 
                 his chest puffed out. The bully said, 
             " What are you lookin at, Munchkin?" 
                James replied, "Stop bullying Ronald!" 
               But then The bully started walking towards 
                 James and peering over him like 
                a bear about to maul someone. 
               But just like that, The bullies walked 
                away, [] they never bullied Ronald again.
