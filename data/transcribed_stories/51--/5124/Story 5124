5124 -         Sekigahara: The change in Japan

               Prologue  
 
   Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the greatest kampaku ever, is 
about to die. He summons his most trusted ally, Ishida 
Mitsunari, to his deathbed. 

   "Sakichi, please take care of Hideyori." groans 
Hideyoshi. 
   Hideyoshi then breathes his final breath, and 
passes away. It is September 21, 1598, Fushimi Castle, 
Fushimi, Japan.

               Tokugawa Ieyasu

   Tokugawa Ieyasu. The most powerful man in 
Japan (after Hideyoshi's death), is now disputing 
with Ishida Mitsunari, about who will succeed Hideyosh 
   Kato Kiyomasa has just come back from Joseon 
(Korea) after an unsuccessful attempt to invade Ming 
(China). 

   "I want to sue Ishida Mitsunari for neglect of 
going to Joseon!" yells Kiyomasa 

   It is September 1599, one year after Hideyoshi died, 
in Fushimi Castle.

 " Yes Kiyomasa, I agree, we will sue Mitsunari." said 
 Ieyasu 

   Little does Ieyasu know, Mitsunari's spies heard 
everything

               Ishida Mitsunari

   Mitsunari heard about this, sued Kiyomasa, and Kiyomasa 
was placed under house arret. 

   One year passed, and the tension in between Mitsunari 
and Ieyasu was extremely high. There was destined to be 
a battle, but where was it going to be. Mitsunari was in 
Osaka and Ieyasu was in Fushimi. They both knew 
where they would fight, Sekigahara.

               Sekigahara

   Mitsunari and Ieyasu both push their way to the 
two castles at the ends of Sekigahara. Mitsunari has 
many generals, like Mori Terumoto, Ukita Hideta, and 
Kobayakawa Hideaki. 

   "Fire!" yells Ukita Hideta 
                                                      2

  The battle rages on for three hours. Kobayakawa 
is no where to be seen. 

   "Where is Kobayakawa?" asks Mitsunari, "I sent 
   him fourteen letters already." 

   Little does Mitsunari know, he is about to 
be crushed. 
                 Chapter 4
                 A stunning defection 
   "Charge!" yells Kobayakawa. 

   Kobayakawa turned on Mitsunari, and crushed 
his forces, along with Ieyasu's forces. Within three 
hours, the battle is over. Ieyasu has won. 

                 Chapter 5
                 New Japan 
   Mitsunari was executed, the Toyotomi Clan crushed 
and Ieyasu became the ruler of Japan. However, Hideyo, 
survived. 

   In 1615, Hideyori was killed, bringing an end to 
the Toyotomi rule.
