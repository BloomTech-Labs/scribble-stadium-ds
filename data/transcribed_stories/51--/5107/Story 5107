My mother says I need to go to a place where people can relate to me. She wants 
us to move away. to a different part of the big, watery salad that the world is. 
"It's time to go, Hun," my mother yells from her office.
"No way. It's like you're trying to take the life out of me" I have friends too. My mom 
needs to see that. 
"You know what? Fine. I'll give you 2 months. I'll see if work is getting any better." 
I decide to make the most of what I have. Two months. But it's not like I 
can do anything. 
After all, I'm paralyzed. 
                                                      can
"How am I even supposed to make the most of this if I ^ only [] lie in 
bed and talk?" 
"Call some of your friends." 
"How am I supposed to pick up a phone?" 
"I'll do it." 
"Don't try to get caught up in my life." 
"I'm not. You're the one picking a fight." 
"Whatever, Mom! Pick up the phone and call Chari. But hold it up to my ear and 
DON'T LISTEN!" 
"Well, okay then." My mom picks up her cell phone. I can hear it ringing and 
then I hear Chari's mom. 
"Hello!" 
"Hi. It's Rubin, Clara's mom." 
"Oh hi! Chari's been dying to talk to Clara. After the accident... I'm so sorry." 
"Oh, thank you, but Clara's feeling a lot better now." 
"That's great to hear!" 
"Maybe can Chari come over to hang out with Clara for a bit?" 
"Chari would be delighted!"

"Also, do you know Avi's number?" 
"Yup! I heard her hang up and call that number. 
"Hello?" 
"Hi! Is this Avi?" 
"Yes, who is this?" 
"Robin, Clara's mother." 
"Oh, salutations, Rubin! How's Clara?" 
"Doing better. Chari's coming over, can Haddix?" 
"[] Absolutely! He would be happy to!" 
I hear all this and I realize I never got to talk to Chari or Haddix. 
"Are you kidding me, Mom?" 
"No." And she left. 
I was so sad and I thought about Balleitt, my best friend who is very sick. I feel 
            in[]ured
like I'm not [] enough compared to her. She has Lukemia, a form of cancer. 
She was always there for me. 
Chari and Haddix could not end up coming. 
And Balleitt died. 
My mom and I grew closer and closer after Balleitt's death. She was the glue 
that kept us together. 
And I will always remember what my mom told me: 
"Everyone has their share of life."
