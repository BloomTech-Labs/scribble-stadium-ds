5111         The Love of True Parents
Daniel was only three years old when his 
mom was sent off to jail right after his 
dad left him to go on a work trip, but never 
came [] back. 

The poor baby at the time had no idea 
what was happening. But he was in 
a foster home. He was just waiting to be taken 
out. He got older, and older, and older. But as 
the years past, it became less of a chance 
of being [] taken out. Nobody wants 
to foster an older kid. Because everybody knows 
that it's the small moments when your 
        really
younger ^ that count. 

Daniel kept getting into more and more trouble 
it the foster home because he finally got 
what was happening. He would probably never 
get a real home.

Until one hot, sunny afternoon... A couple 
came in with their baby in the stroller, and 
said, "Are we eligible to adopt a child?" 
"Well," said the manager, "let me check your records." 

Daniel watched from a small corner hoping he would get out.

"Yes," said the foster manager,[]"you sure are 
eligible." 

                                 exclaimed,
"Yes! We are honey[]," the woman [] "we are 
eligible!"

The man asked his wife, "Can we try to get a teenager?" 
"Sure," the wife said, "why not?" 

Daniels eyes lit up with happiness. "Please pick me, 
please pick me." He thought to himself. 

"Are you alright with that boy in the corner?" 
                   "he's
asked the manager.  [] been here for over 
10 years?"

"Absolutely!" 

Daniel stood up and went to give his new parents 
                          m 
a huge hug. "Thank you so []uch!" 
"You are very welcome, young man."
