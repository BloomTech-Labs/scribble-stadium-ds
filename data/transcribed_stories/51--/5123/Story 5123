5123 - 
One day a builder walked into a house. He 
didn't like to build but it was his only 
job. He was building a banister for the 
staircase, It took him about 2 hours 
to build the banister. Then he put it on 
the wall going up the staircase. 
   "Where does the drill go?" asked 
the builder. "In the kitchen" I said. So, 
as [] the builder [] was putting buck the 
drill I looked at the banister. It looked 
really bad. I asked him "Is this the one 
I picked out?" "NO" he said "Thut one we 
didn't have in stock." "What! I wanted that 
on and I hute this one!" "I understand" 
he exclaimed. "I will get that one for you 
and replace it for free. "Thank You!" I said 
The builder left and in a week cume 
 back and installed the right banister 
 this time. The banister was perfect. 
 "I love it." I said. The banister went 
 to good vse for many years.
