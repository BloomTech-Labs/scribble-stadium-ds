"Give me back my cheese!" yelled Slob. 
"I never took it! You big dumbo!" answered Bob. 
"Stop lying to me! You even drank my water!" Slob 
slowly crept toward Bob, his eyes blaring. 
"First of all, there's a water jountain over there. Second 
of all, stop accusing me oj everything!" 
"How dare you keep lying to me! I have eyes, you know!" 
Slob picked up a plate and prepared to throw. 
"It sure doesn't look like you have eyes," Bob sneered. 
"What did you say, you overgrown pig!" Slob jlung 
the plate at Bob like a bullet. Bob nimbly dodged 
the plate. "Come and get me slowpoke!" 
"I've had it with you and your lying! Now get over 
here!" Slob chased Bob around the table jor 5 minutes. 
"You tired yet?" asked Bob 
"No, and I will get you!" 
"Then come at me!" said Bob. Slob charged at Bob, but 
Bob did not move! At the last second Bob kicked 
Slob in the stomach, and the cheese came jlying out oj 
Slob's mouth. 
"You happy now?" asked Bob. 
"What... about... the water?" said Slob while clutching 
his stomach. 
"Oh be quiet and just use the water jountain." 
"I'm sorry Bob, I just got coryused."
"It's okay, next time think about what you are saying!" 
"Okay, I will," and with that Slob and Bob walked out 
of the dining room.
