There was a little girl, her name was 
Alexa. Alexa had not been in in the real 
world before. She had been homeschooled 
since she was six. Every night she would 
hear her parents say, "She is just not ready 
for school yet." Her parents said this because 
  Alexa has to wear Kruches her whole life. 
Her parents were afraid that she would get picked 
on and teased. Alexa was sick of this. She 
would cry all day. Her plan was to show 
            that 
her parents [] she could handle school. "Mom, 
[] I made two new friends when I 
when I went to the park, see I don't have 
trouble making friends." "Mom, I started 
an instagram acount and I have 128 
friends." Alexas parents talked over on 
how she was doing so well. They decided 
to send her to Jordan Primary school.

Now Alexa is the most ^ girl in her grade 
and she is so happy. Don't judge a book 
by its cover!
