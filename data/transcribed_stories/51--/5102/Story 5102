 There I was flying over a cliff. 
My name is Trey, and I am a 
car. I live in Arizona. I am a free 
car, meaning [] nobody owns me. I was 
built by my friend Steve. Everyday 
[] [] [] [] [] [] 
[] I go to Steve's shop where he fixes 
me up. I am one of Steve's five 
cars Everyday I take him for a 
ride [illustration]

     I have never met another 
human other than Steve. until now. When I 
finally land on the other end of the cliff
I see Steve talking to a big and 
muscular man. Steve's face was completley 
white. and he was yelling. When I got 
closer I heard what they were saying. 

"I'm sorry but I can't sell you the []car
 Percy!"
 "Why not Steve, I thought you hated 
the car." 
"I didn't say that!"
"That car is like a peice of junk."[] said 
the muscular man in a mocking tone, "You even 
[] [] gave it a name, what was it, Trey."

Finally Percy handed Steve a green peice of 
paper.

[] Just like that my life changed. 
I spent three horible years with 
Percy. He would always hit me if he 
did not get some where on time.

   One day I decided to go 
on a ride by myself. Just as I was 
leaving I saw Steve coming in 
with the same green peice of 
paper I saw 3 years ago.

   Once again I was riding of the 
edge of a cliff with Steve.
