The day I got my dog was the 
day my mother died. It wasn't the 
dog's fault, it really wasn't. Bosco was 
already an old dog when I got him. My 
father had told me to got one of the 
younger puppies so I could watch 
 him or her grow. My little sister 
was so taken by this young puppy that 
was bouncing around her feet. I didn't 
care. I wanted Bosco. My mother supported 
me in my decision. She would always 
support me. 
   "Lelina," She would say, "when the world 
falls apart and no one is there anymore, 
know that I will be there. I'll stand on 
your side when everyone on Earth is 
against you. And when the choice comes, 
your father and sister will too." 
   The only problem was that she wasn't 
here anymore. She was gone. My world had 
gone with her. 
   We drove home that fateful day and 
opened the front door. Bosco ran in and raced 
through every room. We chased after him 
screaming, "Bosco! Bosco come back!" He 
didn't listen. 
   We had decided on the name in the 
car. Bosco just seemed so natural.

I looked at Bosco and the first thing that 
came to mind was Bosco. I don't know 
why. 
   We finally caught up to Bosco in the 
living room. We encompassed him and slowly 
started moving around, making our circle 
tighter. That's when it happened. 
   When I think back, it seems like a fairytale 
sort of thing. Something that only happens in 
 those stories, but not in real life. Bosco 
jumped onto the couch and leaped onto our low 
hanging chandelier. How did he even do 
that? He was supposed to be Old! 
   As soon as Bosco got onto the chandelier, 
he ran, beginning to loosen it. We all backed 
away but my mother was too late.... 
Apparently there wasnt a lot holding our 
chandelier into the ceiling. 
   It fell. Right on top of my mom. The 
seconds in which the chandelier 
 was falling I hoped and prayed that my 
mother would run, but she and I both 
knew that there wasn't enough time. 
She looked at me and mouthed, "I will always 
be there." And then she died. I was 
oblivious to the scream that escaped 
my lips and the tears pouring down 
my face.

   The funeral was horrible. We 
 burned her, because that was what 
she had always wanted. Instead 
of having her ashes kept, she had 
wanted to be spread across the fields, 
so she could live with nature. 
Thats what we did. The only thing 
I had left of her was a picture 
Of the whole family at the state fair. 
   I guess I did come to terms with 
mother's death. Bosco helped me 
the most, because after a while, I realized 
that my mother had wanted Bosco too, making 
him another thing my mother had left 
me. 
   My father had wanted to get rid 
of Bosco. "Stupid dog," he said, "Killed 
my wife." 
   I didn't let him. I explained my []
him and he grudgingly agreed. Secretly, 
I think that Bosco helped Father too. 
He really is a sweet dog. 
In the end, everything turned out okay. I 
believe my mother got what she wanted in life. 
I'm happy if she's happy. She was happy 
so I am happy. My mother was right. 
In a way, when I feel the worst, I 
feel her presence. Even though She is not

physically here, I know she will always 
be in my heart.
