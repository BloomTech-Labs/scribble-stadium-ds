Once there was a female black lab named 
Razzle. Razzle was about two years old 
and enjoying a happy life with her 
owner Barbara. Although Barbara was 
very old, she still enjoyed walking 
Razzle, playing with her, and doing 
normal - things a dog owner would 
do with their dog. But there was one 
 set-back. Barbara has been suffering 
from cancer for about ten years. 
Her doctors had told her that she 
was slowly dying. Her cancer was 
getting worse and worse and there 
was really no cure for it. Razzle 
 was always by her owners side. 
Even though Razzle got scared at 
night when her owner would cough 
and wheeze very bad she still loved 
Barbara and couldn't wait for the 
 future. One day while Razzle was 
getting walked, [] Barbara 
collapsed. Fortunately, one of her 
neighbors called the police and ambu-
lance immediately. Barbara was 
unconcious when they reached the 
hospital. When the doctors scanned

Barbara, they found something in her 
lungs. They need to preform surgurey 
immediately. Unfortunately, when they 
started the surgury Barbara 
had died. Razzle was in that hospital 
room and heard the doctors speaking. 
"We need to tell all the family 
members about what happened." said 
one of the doctos. "How should we 
do that, and what about the dog?" 
said another doctor. "One of those 
I don't know, but that dog needs 
      to 
to go ^ the shelter." Razzle knew 
that one word. Shelter. She had 
to go to the shelter. Razzle was terrified 
She didn't know what to do. 
About two weeks later, Razzle was 
in the shelter. She didn't know this 
place at all. She was scared. 
All of the dogs always barked. 
Razzle just slept. She saw dogs 
always getting taken out and going 
to their forever homes. Finally, It 
was Razzle's turn. There was a 
 Kind family who looked at Razzle, 
 gave her treats, and said "we'll 
take her." Razzle had heard these

words before. She was overly excited. 
 She knew they were going to be 
 her forever home. She was Still 
 upset and missed Barbara. But, 
  she couldn't wait for her future 
 home and life.
