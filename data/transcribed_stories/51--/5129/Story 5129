5129 - #1
   I have the worst birthday. My brother 
was born on the same exact day. He always 
steals all the attention. One year I got one 
gift while he got 10. It wasn't fair. I never 
have birthday parties. He gets them all. When I 
try to tell my parents they say, "He is only four. Give 
it a break." 
   While he is only four I am ten. Later 
on I realized that this was the least of my problems. 
Let me tell you want happened on my tenth 
birthday. 
   My brother woke me up when the sun started 
coming up. It was torture. Every year he sings this 
song to wake me up and it is so annoying. 
 "Shut Up!" I told him. 
   "Do you want me to tell on you?" he 
asked. 
   "I don't care just shut up!" I replied. 
So he went. 
   "Daddy!!" 
   I decided not to listen. After all I didn't care. 
Instead I tried my best to go back to sleep. I 
couldn't. So I got up and saw only my dad. 
" Hey dad," I said, "where's Mom?" Dad didn't 
even hear me because he was to busy 
playing and jumping around singing the 
annoying song with my brother So, I assumed Mom

just went to do some last minute shopping. 
I went to the kitchen to get myself some 
cereal when I heard an ear piercing scream. 
   " What happened?" I yelled. I thought someone 
was in trouble. 
   " Daddy got me two tickets to a baseball game!" 
screamed my brother. 
   "Sorry son, there were only two left," said my 
dad, "I hope you don't mind." 
   "Of course not." I replied. Of course that 
was not true. Why did he get tickets if there were 
 only two left? 
   While my brother was opening gifts, there were 
none for me cause Dad said they didn't know what 
to get, I was watching TV all by myself just like 
always. 
   When my dad and brother went to 
see the baseball game my mom came home. 
   "How's your birthday so far ?" asked my mom. 
   "What do you think?" I answered, "Nothing 
special has happened. It feels like any other 
day." 
   "Well I am about to make it better." 
said my mom. 
   My mom picked up a box she brought 
in with her. At first I didn't notice it. I thought 
it was more gifts for my brother, but then it started 
moving.

   "What's in the box?" I asked. She 
didn't reply. She opened it and out came 
a puppy. 
   "What!" I said. 
   From then on I never complained about 
my brother.
