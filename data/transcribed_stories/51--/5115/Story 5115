On a sunday afternoon, there was a girl. The 
girl was named "Shay." Shay had a great life. 
 Basicly was an an average 11 year old girl. She 
had a dream that did not [] [] 
make her average. Her dream was 
about her in Space. Shay's dream had her 
on the Moon, and creating space 
oufits. She told everyone though it 
was cool, exept Abby. Abby and Shay 
were friends in first grade then they found 
new friends. Abby was mean, very mean. At school 
Abby said, "Being a space and oufit engineer 
designer is so uncool." Shay got mad. But 
she would not let Abby dull her sparkle. 
Shay said, "Girl please, trying dull my 
sparkle won't make you any better." 
"Be nice and don't do anything rude." 
20 years later. Shay was creating 
electonic clothes and now 
NASA has cool, better, new things!
