   I lied awake waiting for something. I was alone with my 
thoughts, but all I could think of were chinchillas and milk 
that smelled like vinigar with eggs. I decide to go 
outside to walk my dog, Butch, he is a Yellow Lab. 
When I open the door I relize my whole world is 
going to change. I walk out the door and take Butch 
with me. "Never leave my side," I tell him. He gives me 
a look that makes me know he understands. I wander 
around for a minute, and then I try to go back 
inside my house, but it is gone. Suddenly I look 
down and there is a Mosaic Chinchilla, my favorite kind. 
Beside it is 2 cup of milk. It is the kind that you 
might find in a cafeteria. I pick up the cup and it 
smells like vinigar mixed with eggs. 
   "Is this my imagination," I say. 
   "Hello" says a happy voice from behind me. 
   "Ahhh." I cover my face in terror. Butch goes up to 
the voice and wags his tail. 
   "Hi Serena, do you remember me?" I slowly take my 
hands off my eyes." It's me Blue, your imaginary friend." 
   "This is your mind, and the only way to get out is to 
fully understand why you are here." 
   "Then what am I here," I say in a paniked voice. 
   "What were you doing lying in your room this morning?" 
   "Thinking."
   "Incorrect." 
   "I was so thinking."

   "No, you thought about random things because you wanted 
 to know what you were waiting for." 
   "Then what was I waiting for?" 
   "Maybe, someone." 
   "Someone whc?" I said starting to get mad. 
   "Someone who left." 
   "Ughhh!" 
   "You know what I mean." 
   "Do you mean my dad to get back from his businuss 
trip?"
   "No." 
I thought for a little bit. 
   "Oh. You mean my mom," I say in a sad voice. "There's 
no point she has been diployed. She won't be back for 
years." 
   "Oh yes she will. Just believe end it will happen." 
I did it, and suddenly me and Butch are standing in 
my living room. My mom is standing there. we run 
together and hug. It could last forever.
