"Loser!" Someone called after me. 
I sighed. I was hopeless. Every day 
it was something. Someone would call 
me a name, threaten me, or worse, hurt 
me. 
 It is because I'm different. I look 
 different, I wear different clothes, and 
 so I have no friends. I am the school 
 joke, only it is not funny, not to me. 
 Wednesday started out just like any 
 other day. I got teased, shoved, and 
 kicked. Everyone ignored me. I was not 
 like them, So I was nothing. 
  After school, I came home to the little 
 red house on the corner. As usual, 
no one was there waiting for me. 
  I did my homework, then decided 
 to go for a walk. 
  I had been walking for at least 
 ten minutes when I saw a baseball 
fly up into the air. It came closer and 
closer... 
   Then, everything went black. 
  I looked around and saw someone 
 who looked just like me, exept older. 
 I wondered if this was a dream.

   Looking closer, I realized that 
 the older person was Me! I was 
 receiving some type of medal, and 
 everyone smiled at me. 
   "Congratulations to our Nobel Peace 
   Prize winner. Your contributions to our world 
   have changed lives. We hope you will 
   continue to do great things in the 
   future," said the person who gave me 
   the medal. 
     That was when I opened my 
    eyes. I was a little disappointed 
    when I found out it was just a 
    dream.              
                     where the ball
                     hit me
     My head throbbed,^ but I 
    still smiled as I walked home. 
      Sure, I might be different, and everyone 
     might still hate me, but now I know 
    I can do great things. 
     So when they call, 
     "Freak!"
     "Weirdo!"
     "Loser!"
    I will just hold My head up high, 
    and act as if they were compliments.
