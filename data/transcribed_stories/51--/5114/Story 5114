                                                 was
[]No! Please!" I cried at the vet. My only friend ^ 
in my arms about to be Killed. I tried to 
run away but my mom wouldn't let me. Then 
they injected the needle and there she died. So
peacefully. 

  It's been 5 years since my dog died and 
I still look up at the starry Night 
because it is a portal to heaven. That's 
where my dog is. I believe she can come 
back. 
  "Come on are you going to make dinner?!"
Yelled a scratchy voice. My mom. Treating 
me badly day after day. 
  "Coming!" I yelled back. I ran inside to 
make dinner. I could smell her horrid perfume 
coming closer. I did not want to be beaten 
up again so I started quickly. When I 
was finished I served them, got none 
as usual, then went to my bedroom, which 
was the attic where the possums lived. 
That night I dremt About the popular group at 
my school. The leader did something to my 
dog named Fluffy. She put  something in 
Fluffy's food. But before I could  see 
what it was, I woke up.

   The next day I went tn school in my 
ragged clothes. She walks in with a possy
    behind her, a face with no makeup yet 
so beautiful. Everyone applaudes. I walk up to 
her and say, "What did you do to my dog?" 
 Everyone gasps. Noone has ever dared 
to confront Roxy. She chuckles, "Little kid 
you don't know anything." But one girl in the 
  possy, the truthful one says, "Uhhh, 
 Roxy put pois-" But Roxy shushes her. 
    "You put poison in my dog's food!?" I 
scream.
    "Uhhh yeah?" say Roxy. And as soon as 
she says that, a dog appears in 
my arms and it's Fluffy!
