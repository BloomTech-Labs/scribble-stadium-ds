One day, in the middle of 
 August, there was a boy and 
a girl sitting on their couch []
[] It was a hot summer 
 day, but neither of them 
wanted to go outside and play 
or even just chill. So, they decided 
 to sit down, have a snack, and 
 watch television. They turned on 
 the t.v. and Starting looking 
  for shows to watch. The girl, 
  went up to their kitchen to grab 
  some soda. When she came 
  back, she realized that the 
  boy had already chosen a show, 
  not even asking her if its ok!
  The girl was furious and livid. 
  She shouted, "Hey! Why did you 
  choose the show without me!" 
   The boys response was, 
"I don't know. You shouldn't 
have left." 
    "Well then, we need to 
find a solution to both agree
 on a show we like," replied the 
girl. 
   Then, their journey began.

 Searching, and searching, they 
  tried thousands and thousands 
  of shows, but they could not 
 find one that they BOTH liked. 
 So, they came up with something. 
   "Why don't we watch one episode 
of your show and one episode 
 of my show!" said the girl. 
    "Fine. That works. But I 
 call dibs on watching the show 
   that I like!" said the boy. 
    And then they finally 
 agreed, sat down, and began 
  watching their show. The end.
