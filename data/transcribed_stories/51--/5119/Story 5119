   I lied awake all night in my bed, 
waiting for him. He never came I cried for 
him to come home. I knew what it meant 
I knew the truth. I just did not want to 
believe it. 
   The next morning, the found me. I ran 
away, but there were too many of them. Slowly 
I was dragged away from my life. All of 
it. They took me to a place of strange 
noises and people. I braided my long, black hair 
and forcesd myself to go meet someone. I needed 
to know where I was. The first person I 
asked was a little green boy standing next to 
his blue parent I asked, " Do you know 
where we are?" 
   "Here?"
   "Yes, here." 
   "No, the guards in white armor and silver 
swords don't say anything." 
   I sighed. I walked away and as 
I was about to sit down, I saw 
a little kid crying. He was about 10, I guessed 
I walked over to him."Why are you crying?" 
I ask"ed." And what is your name?" The young 
boy stared at me and said a very alarming 
question
   "Who did you lose?" 
   "Heather. My sister. And her twin Sabine." 
The young boy said finally, "My

name is Roan Freemaker My sister ,Kordi 
was taken. I am cring because she is gone. 
They will be gone too. Do you know a boy?" 
   " Yes, I do. His name is Skylander. Have you 
seen him? 
   "What's he look like?" 
   "Red hair, neatly combed, red shirt, black 
pants, and gray hoodie?" 
   "Yes. We may be able to save him. 
Follow me." 
   We ran across the yard. I noticed 
it was surrounded by shock wire. The guards 
were sendng us in a line. All of us. I 
would say about 50. We were led down 
a tunnel. One of the guards said, "Start 
working." We Were in a mining guild. 
Suddenly, I realized, "Roan, we have to get out 
of here." 
   "You didn't know?" 
   "Of course I did n't know!" 
There is no escape.[]
   "What do we do?" 
   "You and I are proably going to 
hoal coal. You work here for 14 hoursa 
day, Sleep for 7, and eat for 5 minutes. Your 
lucky."
   "How. wait look! It's Skylander!" 
I ran over to him. He looked into my 
eyes and said, "We are getting out o[]

here. Let's go." I pulled back." No, we are 
bringing Roan. "OK, fine," he said  giving up. 
'I have an idea," piped Roan. "We clon-." Skylander 
started, but I elbowed him. and said, "Let's 
hear it Roan." After some arguing, I got 
tha[] there was a truck coming in. We would 
ride that truck and jump off at a village 
Then we would hike to Minecratorian 
world and get a new home. Let's Go" 
   The Galatic Empire never found us. 
We escaped, leaving a note with our 
plan behind for the green boy and his 
family. Skylander and I adopted Roan. When 
he was 12, he accidently drank a non- 
aging potion. 4 years after that, The 
Galatic Empire fell Roan became a Jedi 
and trained at Wings Academy. I was 
his master. We lived on eur farm for 
50 years. My name is Samantha. I am 
someone who can be whoever you 
want me to be. I am a LEGO.
