   Bobby and Dug are best friends 
they are both normal kids, they play sports, like 
candy, and go to the same school. One day they 
had an argument about what sport is better 
soccer or football. "Soccer is better!" exclaimed Bobby, "No, 
footbal is!" shouted Dug. This argument would go on for 
hours. "Soccer is lame, football is awasome." Dug said, clenching 
his fist "football is about people tackling eachother and 
yelling at each other." Bobby pointed out. 

   "Football!", "Soccer!", "football!","Soccer!" The 
two bickered like an old married couple about what 
sport is better, getting nothing done. By the time Bobby's 
parents got home, they were tired, they bad worked an 
almost 9 hour shift. Having the two boys bicker 
wasn't the logi[]al thing to do.
