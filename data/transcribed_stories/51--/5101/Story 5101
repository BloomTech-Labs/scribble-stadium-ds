   In the hallway of the [] John .F .Kenedy 
  School, A big conflic [] originated 
between two boys, weather Ferrari is better 
 or Lamborgini.
  "Ferraries don't have as much nor[]se power 
  but they are more expensive," said one boy. 
  "Nobody cares about how expensive some thing 
  is, Lamborgini has more horse power." 
   "Oh Please," said the other boy, "Ferrari 
makes faster cars." 
   "Thats not true, when I watched a video 
  on TV the Lamborgini went against 
 the [] Ferrari and the Lamborgini Won!" 
   "Well that is [] Just one case," he said. 
I watched formula one and all the Ferraries [] 
 [] won and all the Lamborginis lost." 
  "I [] don't beiieve you." The other boy 
pulled out his iPhone and showed him a video. 
  "I b[]eiive you now," the boy said emmbarrassed.
  "Bye! See you in class!"
  "Bye!" 
  And that is now the conflict ended.
