"Your not going to town;" said coach sasha, "Your going to loose!" 
I ignored her and continued to do my yurochenko. I love vault. It is my strongest 
event. But []now I was told I was going to loose. Hi. My name is Franchesca Smith 
and I love gymnastics. It is the best sport around. But my coach doesn't like my vault. She says it is 
too boring. I continued to do my yurochenkos when suddenly, I fell. I heard a really loud scream but 
I had no idea who it was. Then next thing I know I am at the hospital with a cast on my knee. 
" What happened?" [] I asked to my mom. She looked like she had just cried all night 
and did not sleeap. 
" Well honey. You know your biggest rival out there, Levi davidson. She paid a guy to hit you in your 
                         boyfriend
knee. He had been her ex-[]. They thought [] you would beat her. So she took her chances and 
hit you." I was flabbergasted. I was so mad, yet so in pain. I was going to the [] 
nationals and I couldn't compete And she could. 
 " How long am I supposed to just lie around and do nothing?" I asked. Still shucked. 
                              to do gymnastics again
 "1 week. Then you will start ^ and maybe, just maybe be able to compete." 
 So after a week, I was started to do my skills again. I was scared to do 
vault but I did it. [] 

  Then it was competition day. I saw Lexi []avidson priding herself with the poperazzi. 
 Well, I ignored her [] and did my vault. I stuck it and got a 9.652 and then it 
was Lexi's turn. She did a tsuk and got a 9.65. I had also got better 
scores on floor[] and bars. She beat me in beam. So I had [] 
won! I won! 
 " Mom, I won!" I had beaten Lexi. 
 " Wait. What is happening to her?" I asked Mom.
 " She is getting stripped of her medals because she paid to hit you." 
 I felt bad for her but I won and felt great.
