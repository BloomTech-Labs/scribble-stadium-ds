Holmes,2017-04-25 02:27:19,"Once apon a time there was a girl named Mary. On a warm 
sunny day Mary was walking through the woods near hear nouse 
to look for some critters to take pictures of. She loved animals 
and nature all her life even though she was only nine years old 
She thinks that she is going to die soon. She does go to school 
but she isn't that smart. For example Mary recycled a pie 
even though the pie was not even bitten. Another thing she did 
was leave her muffin in the woods while she was traveling with  
her family to Andrea's house which is one of Mary's friends at 
school and Mary's muffin was eaten by a bear that sniffed it 
from far away. Yes. Mary could be a little weird but that is 
just how she is. Back to the real story now. Mary found a 
fox, took a picture she also found a rabbit took a picture 
she found a squirrel and took a picture before it ran away. 
But sooner or later she saw two eyes peeking through a bush 
on the side of the path she was walking on. Then the 
creature slowly came out of the bush. It was a bear. The bear 
growled at Mary. Mary was terrifyed. She started running and 
running but she could still see the bear growling behind her. This 
was the end of Mary. Mary was approaching her house she 
could see it now. She was safe in her house. She was now 
really scared. She could possibly be eaten but she made it to 
the door opened it and slammed it shut before the bear could 
get in. She ran or sprinted rather up to her room. ""I'm alive!!"" 
She cried. I just can't belive it I'm alive!!"" Mary was so 
relifed she told her mom and dad and her brother. And that 
night Mary was kissed goodnight and tucked into bed. And that 
is the only brave time of her life.",Photo 3101.jpg

                I am almost 12.^ MY birthday is in
                                   2 months.
Hello I am Bob. ^ I live a good life
with tempatures as hot as the summer 
in Texas. And by the way I live 
in Alaska. I don't know how but 
school is not as normal as it was 
             I'm the only child in my family.
in Virginia. ^ I miss Virginia. 
School here was alot of homework, 
no recess, and lunch was the same 
everyday which is the worst.
But life is getting better. ""Bob were
getting a new child."" said Mom. NO.
Where getting a younger sibling. The 
[illustration with caption] one time life goes good it 
[illustration with caption] goes back down to the 
[illustration with caption] worst. Ughh I don't like life.
[illustration with caption] Who knows my sibling could
gonna annoy me like crazy? Or 
can steal all the attention. Ughh this 
is like winter in Alaska. Today is my 
first day in 5th grade. ""Look at your 
lovely baby"" said Dad. What? I wispered.
I tried to act like I like it but that 
didn't go so well. My best friend Hayden 
moved to Nevada. So I have to make 
friends from scratch.""1 new Person 
is coming this year."" said Mike. Mike is 
my friend. But me and Hayden have been friends 
3115
for like 10 years. I always thought he 
would stay with me. ""Hey guys"" said 
the new kid Shyly. ""My name is 
Gerrard"". Now is lunch, and remember
when I said it was the same lunch 
every day well guess what today 
was cheeseburgers. Yay. It's usally 
corn on the cob. But today Gerrard 
got dissappointed that there was no 
recess. But then 4th grade, 3rd grade, and 
2nd grade all had recess. Mo fair!
The next day we had recess. Yay.It was 
-31◦F.""Brrr!"" We froze to death. We 
Played too joyfully I never got 
tagged because I'm the fastest 
in the school. So today I was 
BABYSITTING the baby. Why Mom?
""Because were going out to get ice cream
Said MOM.""Hey I want ice cream to"" 
I yelled. But Mom said no. Bummer.
The baby wasn't that bad until 
she cried becaue I was 
watching a tv show that was 
loud so I muted the volume like a 
sloth. Than He was awesome. Tommorow
everything was awesome. YaY!

"" This is my jungle. I had it first and you cannt not 
steal if from me."" screamed Lion. ""I have Known 
this jungle longer than you were born and it is 
a matter of time till I rule this jungle."" Tiger 
shot back at Lion. Tiger and Lion are having a 
fight because they think that one of them are the best 
and can rule over the jungle and if you want 
to know what the solution of the story is you have 
to keep reading but the only way to solve this 
problem is for Tiger and Lion to go to the peace-
keeper because they were once best friends. ""The only 
way to solve this problem is to go to the peacekeeper."" 
said Tiger. So in a tree probably taller than the sky
the peacekeeper went to work with Lion and 
Tiger. ""So what is the problem?"" the peacekeeper asked 
in a deep voice. ""We both want to rule the jungle."" 
They both said. The peacekeeper said ""Jungle Affwire
is a very old jungle but I have an idea. The idea 
that the peacekeeper had was Jungle Affwire will probably 
die in about two years so Tiger could rule for a 
year and Lion could rule for the last year and the
idea worked and Tiger and Lion had happy lives.",Photo 3118.jpg

""found it"" said Katrina, a villan who roamed around with her 
sidekick, Caterine. They were like cats, except humans. 
They were on the roof of tan apartment and were looking 
 for the museum they never stole from before. 
""lets go"" said Caterine as she did a double flip and 
 unleashed the whip around her waist, followed by 
 Katerina. The whip found a street light as they 
 wrapped it around and landed. they hurried in to 
 the building. ""You can guard and I will look for the 
 trophy"" said Caterine. ""No, I can look for it and 
 you can guard"" said Katrina. They argued but found 
 a plan. They would both look and Caterine's cat and 
 Katrina's kitten would guard because they were 
 very fierce. They soon found the trophy room and 
 Katrina used her claw tool to break the glass. They 
 took the trophy and hurried out but soon 
  they heard the alarm so they took out there 
  whips and wrapped it on the head of 
  the street light and pulled thmeselves 
   up they backfliped onto the building 
  behind them. ""Oh no! The kittens"" caterina 
 said, ""don't worry, I got them"" Katrina said. 
 But the police soon found them and said, 
""your coming with me"". He grabbed them 
and shoved them in the car. ""the kittens will 
be taken care of. They arrived at the 
Jail and were put in together. ""We will find a plan"" said 
Caterine..",Photo 3129.jpg

""Ughhh, this is going to take forever!"" Pri groaned leaning her head 
on the table. Pri and her friend Julie were designing a dress for 
a fashion show in Paris that was in 2 weeks. ""Cheer up Pri, we just 
started. I'm sure that we'll find an idea"" Julie said. ""Ooo, how about 
this?"" Julie said picking up a book with a cool design. ""Thats cool. 
But I was thinking of drawing something else"" Pri said looking at the 
design book. ""Suit yourself, I'm going to draw something similar to this 
design."" While Julie was drawing sketches, Pri got up to find another 
book to look at. While she was walking, she spoted a book that had 
a shiny golden cover that said, ""Designs for girls."" She broght the book 
back to the table and started to skin through it. Then she saw a design 
that was absolutely beautiful, it had golden silk with red lace 
woven through it. Without hesitation, she started right to work. After 
2 more hours drawing and coloring, Pri and Julie were finaly done 
with their drawings. ""So, how do you like mine?"" Julie asked showing 
Pri her paper. It was a tunic with blue silk and green lace along 
with high tops and navy jeans. ""Its awesome! Now how about mine?"" 
Pri asked showing Julie her drawing. It was a shirt with ripped jean shorts 
and the shirt was golden with white lace. ""Well I think I like mine 
better"" said Julie. ""Are you saing mine's not good?!"" Pri said highly 
insulted.  ""No!"" They fighted the rest of the time they were there. 
Then they went home. Pri went to her room, and all of a sudden 
something mind blowing happend. She called Julie and told her 
the idea to combind there creations, and she agreed! they 
worked and worked until the show and they both came 
there wearing... their outfit they made! ",Photo 3130 .jpg

 One day a boy named Ishaan and a girl named 
 Sarah were having a war. Not just any war, this 
war was a dialogue war. What I mean by dialogue 
 war is a fight with dialogue. Ishaan wanted 
to get a dog and Lily wanted to get a cat. 
""I think dogs are the best pet because the playful 
 and cats are steathy and unfriendly. ""Are Not""! 
""Are to""! ""Are not""! ""Are to""! And as you can see 
 it went on and on. Finally, after two 
 hours of endless bickering there 
 mother came and said that they could not 
 get a pet.

One day in the morning I heared a loud crash. I 

woke up with my dog slobering all over me trying to 

wake me up. It wa a sunny Saturday morning, but when 

I got in my backyard but something seemed wrong. 

there was a giant pit dead smack in the middle of 

my pool, and inside of it was a rock. I told ""Mr. Bark""

to stay away while I ""inspected"" it. I thought 

it could be a meteor... or an asteroid... maybe a 

comet.. whatever it was, I knew it was a big pit 

with a rock in it. So we didn't live happily after 

that (maybe.)

On one sunny, morning Jack woke up and was very surprised 
                                    eyes
of what he saw. Right infront of his ^ was a dog. 
Now there was something about this dog that Jack 
noticed. Jake asked the dog a question and asked 
   the dog ""do you have a superpower""? And surpris-
ingly the dog answerd! The dog could actually speek! 
Jack got dressed for school and secretly put 
the dog in his back pack because the dog 
asked Jack if he could come to school with 
him. On Jack's way to school, his best friend 
Brian came running up to him. Jack said ""hey 
Brian, you want to see something cool""? ""Sure""! hel
said. ""Come over here, I'll show you something."" Jack 
carefully unpacked the talking dog from his back pack. 
""You know what, meet me hear right after school"", 
said Brian.

After school Brian and Jake showed up at the 
same place. Brian quickly found out that the dog 
could talk. Brian begged Jack if he could keep 
it and since earlier that year Brian had done 
something very nice Jack gave him the dog. 
After that, Brian went home and played with 
the dog for the rest of the day. 

Brian loved the dog.

Once there was a girl named Lusinda.

Her dream was to be a horse back 
rider when she grew up but the thing was 

that her parents didn't want her horse back 
riding because they didn't want her to 
 get hurt. ""But mom!"" Lusinda shouted, 
  ""you now my dream is to be a horse 

 back rider, and if i'm going to be a horse 

 back rider I need practive. ""Fine, you can 
 start lessons tomorrow"". ""Thank you thank you 
 thank you THANK YOU!!!"" Lusinda 
 was so happy that she decided to 

  look for horses online! She found 
  the horse she wanted, it was white with 
   a strip of pink in her mane. Since she 
    was 16 years old she went and bought it 
    by herself. Her mom was very happy for her. 

    The horse came the following week.
     Lusinda named her new horse Glamour. 

                                             -3208
  She and Glamour got along very well. They started 
  riding the next day. all was great, and Lusinda 
  never got thrown of.

One day, I was just walking to school like I do everyday. 
Normal, right? My best friend walked up to me and 
asked, ""Did you do all of your homework?"" like she 
does everyday. Also normal. I replied, ""Yes, I did,"" like 
I do everyday. As I said, it was a normal day 
walking to school, at least for right now. When you 
go to the Smithson School, you never know what 
to expect. I wondered what might happen today. 
Like maybe aliens would invade the school, or 
maybe books would started out from 
the clouds above the school. Oh! Or maybe our 
principal will suddenly shrink. Or maybe... ""Kelly! Kelly!"" 
""Yes?"" I replied. ""Are you okay?"" asked Kaylee, mu 
best friend's name. ""I called your name five []
times and you didn't answer!"" I said, ""Yes 
I'm fine. I was just daydreaming about 
what might happen at school today."" Kaylee 
made a sour face. Unlike me, she likes things 
ordinary. If you ask me, she should switch schools. 
But then I wouldn't have my best friend 
anymore. When we got to school, we said hi to 
the principal. Again, normal. But then, something 
out of the ordinary happened. We walked into 
school and there was a robot, yes, a robot 
blocking our way! Me and Kaylee huddle closey 
together, shivering. As other children walked into 

the school, the started to turn back. But 
then the door shut and someone locked it 
from outside. Oh my gosh! That was scary. We 
all wanted to run away, but suddenly, we 
were surronded by robots everywhere. They were 
scary. One of them said, ""Put your hands 
up!"" Another one held out a pair of handcuffs. 
They all shouted no, and started running out. 
All, except for my friend []aylee. She started 
talking to them real nicely. I didn't quite 
know what she was saying, but the robot 
nodded. He turned to the rest of the 
robots and said, ""Let's get outta here. We 
were mean. These children don't deserve 
it."" The children all cheered for her. One even 
made her a medal. When we walked out 
of school, Kaylee told me, ""Today was a 
fun day.""

Tanya is really nice though Mrs. Layla comes in she tells us its

""Phew"" said Jack. ""That was narley"". 

Jack was a boy in second grade. 

He was picked to go to space 

with Nasa astronauts. His mother 

""Barbie"" was a little scared about 

this attempt but since Jack loved 

space she let him go. Jack trained

20lb weights everday for 30 

min, he did 100 push-ups before 

trx bands for 20 min, and last he 

boxed with a punching dumie 

for 2 hours.

 One day there was a butterfly named 
 
 Anna and a girl named Lilla. They were 

best friends. If Anna went to the park, Lilla 

had to go to the park to. One day Lilla changed 

her mind on wanting Ama to come with her 

to the movies. So she said, ""I am going 

to the movies without you today."" Anna said, ""NO, 

we do everything together and that will never change."" 

Lilla didn't like what her best friend said though. 

Instead she said, ""Look, we do everything together, I 

just want to have a time where I can be 

alone.  We will still be best friends."" Anna said, 

""Fine, if you go to the movies alone then

Once There was a King named 
baylaf, he ruled over a huge empire. 
Every time someone broke the law 
he would send them to the dragon 
living under the kingdom, ""Think about 
what you did."" he'd say to the 
prisoner. But one day the dragon 
was gone he called his advisors, 
""Fraddle and Fred, get down here!"" 
 Fraddle asked ""What's wrong baylaf?"" 
 The king replied ""The dragon is missing.'"" 
 Fred exclaimed ""I knew it!"" The king 
  was puzzled ""What do you know?"" 
 Fred made a long story, ""So first 
 I heard some rumbling and roaring, 
 then a big crash happened. After 
 that I heard the flapping of wings! 
 So I thought maybe the dragon 
escaped."" the king was very afraid, 
""Okay, so what your telling me is 
 that the dragon escaped."" Fred said 
 ""Yes my great King."" Baylaf ordered, 
  ""I want the best knights and 
   archers to get me back my 
   dragon!"" And so fred and Fraddle 
   got Oguk and Ogurk the best knight 
   and archer in the kingdom.

 to Baylaf alive."" Ogurk said, []
 ""Understood, we will find the dragon."" 
that knight Oguk and Ogurk got 
 on their horses and headed 
 west. Oguk wanted to know why 
 they were going west, ""Why are 
 we going west?"" Oguk asked. Ogurk 
 replied, ""We are going west becuase 
 that's the way the dragon went."" 
 Oguk was about to say something 
  but then a tremendous roar happened. 
""What was that?"" Oguk asked. Ogurk 
 saw it, the dragon, Ogurk answered 
 ""The dragon!"" Oguk fired the trana 
 arrows, ""Attack"" he shouted. Ogurk was 
 gone,""Orgurk!"" Oguk called but as the 
  dragon was limping Ogurk jumped off 
 the rock and stabbed the dragon 
 making it crash into the ground. 
""We did it!"" Oguk exclaimed, ""Let's take 
 it to the king,"" Oguk said. And 
  When the dragon was returned, The king 
 remembered, he forgot to chain 
up the dragon.

  “I wish for a pencil, I wish for a pencil, I wish for a

with a birth animal. She had named her’s Weather, 
so Weather had powers of weather. As for Arania, she 
had the power of wishing. According to her parents,

[]Not many people could get a sharpened pencil on 
their first try. Weather blasted her with a gust of

 Once there was a girl named Sylvie. 
Her best friend was a girl named Alissa. 
They had good times together. One day 
Sylvie sprouted wings (She was actully 
half human half angel) and Alissa said, 
“Hey! Why do you have wings I’ve 
always wings not you. Hmph!” and she 
stormed of before Sylvie could 
explain. After that Alissa was always 
making mean comments  about Sylvie wings 
and ignoring her everytime she tried to 
 talk to her. One day Alissa’s new best 
 friend named Katlyn said to Sylvie, 
“Hi Sylvie I think you should say sorry 
to Alissa and I have to go now!” and she 
raced of leaving Sylvie by herself 
she decided to explain to Alissa that 
she didn’t get wing on purpose so 
she  went to Alissa and said,

""Your not going to town;"" said coach sasha, ""Your going to loose!"" 
I ignored her and continued to do my yurochenko. I love vault. It is my strongest 
event. But []now I was told I was going to loose. Hi. My name is Franchesca Smith 
and I love gymnastics. It is the best sport around. But my coach doesn't like my vault. She says it is 
too boring. I continued to do my yurochenkos when suddenly, I fell. I heard a really loud scream but 
I had no idea who it was. Then next thing I know I am at the hospital with a cast on my knee. 
"" What happened?"" [] I asked to my mom. She looked like she had just cried all night 
and did not sleeap. 
"" Well honey. You know your biggest rival out there, Levi davidson. She paid a guy to hit you in your 
                         boyfriend
knee. He had been her ex-[]. They thought [] you would beat her. So she took her chances and 
hit you."" I was flabbergasted. I was so mad, yet so in pain. I was going to the [] 
nationals and I couldn't compete And she could. 
 "" How long am I supposed to just lie around and do nothing?"" I asked. Still shucked. 
                              to do gymnastics again
 ""1 week. Then you will start ^ and maybe, just maybe be able to compete."" 
 So after a week, I was started to do my skills again. I was scared to do 
vault but I did it. [] 

  Then it was competition day. I saw Lexi []avidson priding herself with the poperazzi. 
 Well, I ignored her [] and did my vault. I stuck it and got a 9.652 and then it 
was Lexi's turn. She did a tsuk and got a 9.65. I had also got better 
scores on floor[] and bars. She beat me in beam. So I had [] 
won! I won! 
 "" Mom, I won!"" I had beaten Lexi. 
 "" Wait. What is happening to her?"" I asked Mom.

""Loser!"" Someone called after me. 
I sighed. I was hopeless. Every day 
it was something. Someone would call 
me a name, threaten me, or worse, hurt 
me. 
 It is because I'm different. I look 
 different, I wear different clothes, and 
 so I have no friends. I am the school 
 joke, only it is not funny, not to me. 
 Wednesday started out just like any 
 other day. I got teased, shoved, and 
 kicked. Everyone ignored me. I was not 
 like them, So I was nothing. 
  After school, I came home to the little 
 red house on the corner. As usual, 
no one was there waiting for me. 
  I did my homework, then decided 
 to go for a walk. 
  I had been walking for at least 
 ten minutes when I saw a baseball 
fly up into the air. It came closer and 
closer... 
   Then, everything went black. 
  I looked around and saw someone 
 who looked just like me, exept older. 
 I wondered if this was a dream. 
5109 
   Looking closer, I realized that 
 the older person was Me! I was 
 receiving some type of medal, and 
 everyone smiled at me. 
   ""Congratulations to our Nobel Peace 
   Prize winner. Your contributions to our world 
   have changed lives. We hope you will 
   continue to do great things in the 
   future,"" said the person who gave me 
   the medal. 
     That was when I opened my 
    eyes. I was a little disappointed 
    when I found out it was just a 
    dream.              
                     where the ball
                     hit me
     My head throbbed,^ but I 
    still smiled as I walked home. 
      Sure, I might be different, and everyone 
     might still hate me, but now I know 
    I can do great things. 
     So when they call, 
     ""Freak!""
     ""Weirdo!""
     ""Loser!""
    I will just hold My head up high, 
    and act as if they were compliments.              ",Photo 5109.jpg

Dragons are real because I have one. His name is Larson, and he is trying to take over the world. Today, he 
is a full-grown diamond-back dragon, but way-back-when, he started as an egg with a height of 6 
inches, and a width of 5 inches. It started when I was 5 years old, wandering on my own in the trade 
market. A young woman ran up to me, a scared, and ashen look on her face. Through her black veil, she said 
""Keep this safe,"" and ran away. In my hand was Larson's egg. It was snaking, as if it was 
trembling with fear. So I took it home, and set it on the wooden floor of the room I shared with 
my four brothers. A silver snout had poked a hole in the egg, and part of a white eggshell 
had littered the floor. So I picked it up and hid the egg under the loose floorboard in the 
ground so that nobody could find it. I was a very sneeky child when I was little, and I 
still am. ""Ruelind Pine! Get down here! We are going to start supper without you!"" Shouted 
my mother in her hoarse voice. She had gotten ill after Gill, my youngest brother, had been 
            older
born, so my ^ brothers made supper. Most of the time, meals were dried fruit, and if we were 
lucky, meat my brothers hunted down. But I was starving from today's hard labor, so I 
didn't dare miss another one of the meals. After I had checked on the egg (which had

orchard, and cheese from the market, when I came back up after praying to the nature 
gods, and hungrily devouring the food. What I saw was a mess of egg shells, a dragon 
and my oldest brother, Pan. That is how we formed an agreement to keep the dragon a 
secret, and accidentaly letting the dragon out years after by leaving the window open. 
Now we are back in the present, I am 12 years old, my brother is 18. We

they injected the needle and there she died. So
peacefully.

I still look up at the starry Night

where my dog is. I believe she can come 
back. 
  ""Come on are you going to make dinner?!""
Yelled a scratchy voice. My mom. Treating 
me badly day after day. 
  ""Coming!"" I yelled back. I ran inside to 
make dinner. I could smell her horrid perfume 
coming closer. I did not want to be beaten 
up again so I started quickly. When I 
was finished I served them, got none 
as usual, then went to my bedroom, which 
was the attic where the possums lived. 
That night I dremt About the popular group at 
my school. The leader did something to my 
dog named Fluffy. She put  something in 
Fluffy's food. But before I could  see 
what it was, I woke up.

so beautiful. Everyone applaudes. I walk up to 
her and say, ""What did you do to my dog?"" 
 Everyone gasps. Noone has ever dared 
to confront Roxy. She chuckles, ""Little kid 
you don't know anything."" But one girl in the 
  possy, the truthful one says, ""Uhhh, 
 Roxy put pois-"" But Roxy shushes her. 
    ""You put poison in my dog's food!?"" I 
scream.
    ""Uhhh yeah?"" say Roxy. And as soon as 
she says that, a dog appears in 
my arms and it's Fluffy!",Photo 5114 pg1.jpg

On a sunday afternoon, there was a girl. The 
girl was named ""Shay."" Shay had a great life. 
 Basicly was an an average 11 year old girl. She 
had a dream that did not [] [] 
make her average. Her dream was 
about her in Space. Shay's dream had her 
on the Moon, and creating space 
oufits. She told everyone though it 
was cool, exept Abby. Abby and Shay 
were friends in first grade then they found 
new friends. Abby was mean, very mean. At school 
Abby said, ""Being a space and oufit engineer 
designer is so uncool."" Shay got mad. But 
she would not let Abby dull her sparkle. 
Shay said, ""Girl please, trying dull my 
sparkle won't make you any better."" 
""Be nice and don't do anything rude."" 
20 years later. Shay was creating 
electonic clothes and now 
NASA has cool, better, new things!

There was a little girl, her name was 
Alexa. Alexa had not been in in the real 
world before. She had been homeschooled 
since she was six. Every night she would 
hear her parents say, ""She is just not ready 
for school yet."" Her parents said this because 
  Alexa has to wear Kruches her whole life. 
Her parents were afraid that she would get picked 
on and teased. Alexa was sick of this. She 
would cry all day. Her plan was to show 
            that 
her parents [] she could handle school. ""Mom,

when I went to the park, see I don't have

thoughts, but all I could think of were chinchillas and milk 
that smelled like vinigar with eggs. I decide to go 
outside to walk my dog, Butch, he is a Yellow Lab. 
When I open the door I relize my whole world is 
going to change. I walk out the door and take Butch 
with me. ""Never leave my side,"" I tell him. He gives me 
a look that makes me know he understands. I wander 
around for a minute, and then I try to go back 
inside my house, but it is gone. Suddenly I look 
down and there is a Mosaic Chinchilla, my favorite kind. 
Beside it is 2 cup of milk. It is the kind that you 
might find in a cafeteria. I pick up the cup and it 
smells like vinigar mixed with eggs. 
   ""Is this my imagination,"" I say. 
   ""Hello"" says a happy voice from behind me. 
   ""Ahhh."" I cover my face in terror. Butch goes up to 
the voice and wags his tail. 
   ""Hi Serena, do you remember me?"" I slowly take my 
hands off my eyes."" It's me Blue, your imaginary friend."" 
   ""This is your mind, and the only way to get out is to

   Bobby and Dug are best friends 
they are both normal kids, they play sports, like 
candy, and go to the same school. One day they 
had an argument about what sport is better 
soccer or football. ""Soccer is better!"" exclaimed Bobby, ""No, 
footbal is!"" shouted Dug. This argument would go on for 
hours. ""Soccer is lame, football is awasome."" Dug said, clenching 
his fist ""football is about people tackling eachother and 
yelling at each other."" Bobby pointed out. 

   ""Football!"", ""Soccer!"", ""football!"",""Soccer!"" The 
two bickered like an old married couple about what 
sport is better, getting nothing done. By the time Bobby's 
parents got home, they were tired, they bad worked an 
almost 9 hour shift. Having the two boys bicker 
wasn't the logi[]al thing to do.",Photo 5122.jpg

One day a builder walked into a house. He 
didn't like to build but it was his only 
job. He was building a banister for the 
staircase, It took him about 2 hours 
to build the banister. Then he put it on 
the wall going up the staircase. 
   ""Where does the drill go?"" asked 
the builder. ""In the kitchen"" I said. So, 
as [] the builder [] was putting buck the 
drill I looked at the banister. It looked 
really bad. I asked him ""Is this the one 
I picked out?"" ""NO"" he said ""Thut one we 
didn't have in stock."" ""What! I wanted that 
on and I hute this one!"" ""I understand"" 
he exclaimed. ""I will get that one for you 
and replace it for free. ""Thank You!"" I said 
The builder left and in a week cume 
 back and installed the right banister 
 this time. The banister was perfect. 
 ""I love it."" I said. The banister went 
 to good vse for many years.",Photo 5123.jpg

   One year passed, and the tension in between Mitsunari 
and Ieyasu was extremely high. There was destined to be 
a battle, but where was it going to be. Mitsunari was in 
Osaka and Ieyasu was in Fushimi. They both knew

song to wake me up and it is so annoying. 
 ""Shut Up!"" I told him. 
   ""Do you want me to tell on you?"" he 
asked. 
   ""I don't care just shut up!"" I replied. 
So he went.

couldn't. So I got up and saw only my dad.

none for me cause Dad said they didn't know what 
to get, I was watching TV all by myself just like

The day I got my dog was the 
day my mother died. It wasn't the 
dog's fault, it really wasn't. Bosco was 
already an old dog when I got him. My 
father had told me to got one of the 
younger puppies so I could watch 
 him or her grow. My little sister 
was so taken by this young puppy that 
was bouncing around her feet. I didn't 
care. I wanted Bosco. My mother supported 
me in my decision. She would always 
support me. 
   ""Lelina,"" She would say, ""when the world 
falls apart and no one is there anymore, 
know that I will be there. I'll stand on 
your side when everyone on Earth is 
against you. And when the choice comes, 
your father and sister will too."" 
   The only problem was that she wasn't 
here anymore. She was gone. My world had 
gone with her. 
   We drove home that fateful day and 
opened the front door. Bosco ran in and raced 
through every room. We chased after him 
screaming, ""Bosco! Bosco come back!"" He 
didn't listen. 
   We had decided on the name in the 
car. Bosco just seemed so natural.

I looked at Bosco and the first thing that 
came to mind was Bosco. I don't know 
why. 
   We finally caught up to Bosco in the 
living room. We encompassed him and slowly 
started moving around, making our circle 
tighter. That's when it happened. 
   When I think back, it seems like a fairytale 
sort of thing. Something that only happens in 
 those stories, but not in real life. Bosco 
jumped onto the couch and leaped onto our low 
hanging chandelier. How did he even do 
that? He was supposed to be Old! 
   As soon as Bosco got onto the chandelier, 
he ran, beginning to loosen it. We all backed 
away but my mother was too late.... 
Apparently there wasnt a lot holding our 
chandelier into the ceiling. 
   It fell. Right on top of my mom. The 
seconds in which the chandelier 
 was falling I hoped and prayed that my 
mother would run, but she and I both 
knew that there wasn't enough time. 
She looked at me and mouthed, ""I will always 
be there."" And then she died. I was 
oblivious to the scream that escaped 
my lips and the tears pouring down 
my face.

   The funeral was horrible. We 
 burned her, because that was what 
she had always wanted. Instead 
of having her ashes kept, she had 
wanted to be spread across the fields, 
so she could live with nature. 
Thats what we did. The only thing 
I had left of her was a picture 
Of the whole family at the state fair. 
   I guess I did come to terms with 
mother's death. Bosco helped me 
the most, because after a while, I realized 
that my mother had wanted Bosco too, making 
him another thing my mother had left 
me. 
   My father had wanted to get rid 
of Bosco. ""Stupid dog,"" he said, ""Killed 
my wife."" 
   I didn't let him. I explained my []
him and he grudgingly agreed. Secretly, 
I think that Bosco helped Father too. 
He really is a sweet dog. 
In the end, everything turned out okay. I 
believe my mother got what she wanted in life. 
I'm happy if she's happy. She was happy 
so I am happy. My mother was right. 
In a way, when I feel the worst, I

Once there was a female black lab named 
Razzle. Razzle was about two years old 
and enjoying a happy life with her 
owner Barbara. Although Barbara was 
very old, she still enjoyed walking 
Razzle, playing with her, and doing 
normal - things a dog owner would 
do with their dog. But there was one 
 set-back. Barbara has been suffering 
from cancer for about ten years. 
Her doctors had told her that she 
was slowly dying. Her cancer was 
getting worse and worse and there 
was really no cure for it. Razzle 
 was always by her owners side. 
Even though Razzle got scared at 
night when her owner would cough 
and wheeze very bad she still loved 
Barbara and couldn't wait for the 
 future. One day while Razzle was 
getting walked, [] Barbara 
collapsed. Fortunately, one of her

had died. Razzle was in that hospital

said another doctor. ""One of those

that one word. Shelter. She had 
to go to the shelter. Razzle was terrified

About two weeks later, Razzle was 
in the shelter. She didn't know this

a lemonade stand ^. The only talking pig family 
in the world, Peppa pig's next door hated lemonade 
and [] if they got cl[]se to it, they would 
get sick because the main disadvantage 
of being a talking pig is you are allergic to lemons. 
So. peppa pig went up to the lemonade stand 
and asked ""Hey, got any grapes, because 
otherwise leave!"" She really liked grapes. 
He said ""No, I don't have grapes and I'm not 
leaving but I'll give you fresh lemonade."" 
Soshe walked home and told her parents, so they 
devised a plan The very next day 
she came with the same statement an[] 
he had the same response, So after 
1 full week of doing this he finally said 
""Okay, come with me to the super market 
to buy some grapes. So when they got there 
they got out and bought grapes and then 
Peppa took them, looking at them for aninde[]
 and then at all of them in one gulp 
because she really liked grapes. [] Meanwhile, 
peppa's parents and brother and their 
godfather and god mother Princess Leia 
 and Darth Vader went to the stand with 
 haz mat suits and destroyed it.

Jack, the middle school student, just opened up 
                during the sumer
a lemonade stand ^. The only talking pig family 
in the world, Peppa pig's next door hated lemonade 
and [] if they got cl[]se to it, they would 
get sick because the main disadvantage 
of being a talking pig is you are allergic to lemons. 
So. peppa pig went up to the lemonade stand 
and asked ""Hey, got any grapes, because 
otherwise leave!"" She really liked grapes. 
He said ""No, I don't have grapes and I'm not 
leaving but I'll give you fresh lemonade."" 
Soshe walked home and told her parents, so they 
devised a plan The very next day 
she came with the same statement an[] 
he had the same response, So after 
1 full week of doing this he finally said 
""Okay, come with me to the super market 
to buy some grapes. So when they got there 
they got out and bought grapes and then 
Peppa took them, looking at them for aninde[]
 and then at all of them in one gulp 
because she really liked grapes. [] Meanwhile, 
peppa's parents and brother and their 
godfather and god mother Princess Leia 
 and Darth Vader went to the stand with 
 haz mat suits and destroyed it. 
                                  -5202
Then, when peppa Pig got back Jlack did not   
 know Peppa's parents were involved so 
  he thought is was a bad neighborhood 
      packed and 
so he ran away and never came back.

April Mically was the most popular girl in 
school. Her school life was amazing but 
her home life was not so good. 
April family is really poor. They barly have 
enough money for a house let alone a 
tv or phone. April made the best 
of it but sometimes she would come 
home crying because her friends got a 
new phone, or a designer bag, or a new 
dress. Her mom always comed her down 
and she was Ok again. 

Summer on the other hand was rich. 
She was not very popular though. Her best 
friend was her dog, Luna. Summer had 
everything. A huge house, like a million dresses, 
the newest iphone, but she didn't have 
friends. 

Over time Summer and April became 
good friends. Summer lended April some 
money when she was in need and April 
let Summer hang out in her friend 
group. 

One day Summer and April pranked 
                          5205
the teach and put thumb tacks on 
the chair. Soon the teachers figured 
it out though and they got into 
trouble. 
""It's your fault April,"" Summer sobbed, ""thanks 
to you our parents are going to 
be here any moment now!"" 
""Look, I didn't Know they had secerity 
cameras here. I'm sorry!"" April sobbed back. 

A few moments later both sets of 
parents walked in. You could obuisly tell 
who was who. After a long talk with the 
princible they were told they needed to 
clean the attic. 

Summer was so mad at April that they 
seperated onto completely different sides. 
Then a huge flash came from the 
side April was on. Summer came running 
over. Suddenly a strong muscular man stood 
before them. He said, ""I am a genie. I 
am here to grant you three wishes. 

April got so excited she made 2 wishes 
right there and then. She wished 
                               5205
""I want 1 million dollars and the 
newest iphone."" 
""Be careful"" warned Summer, ""there is always 
a dark side to the wishes."" 

April didn't listen and soon found out 
it was bad. She found out that she 
turned evil and never trusted a 
genie again. She appologyed to Summer 
and said the she was right. ""I will 
never be tray you again.""

In the summer two friends were talking. 
 Bob the alien said, ""It's so hot outside. I'm like 
 literally melting. Can we go inside?"" Her friend 
 Zoe responded,"" I wanted to go get ice cream 
 inside anyway. Wanna come?"" Inside the girls 
  got ice cream, but Bob was scooping the ice 
  cream while Zoe was in the bathroom 
 washing her hands. When she returned the 
 ice cream was already in the bowls. ""Aaagh!"" 
 screamed Zoe,""You put worms in my ice cream!"" 
 ""No, I didn't,"" replied Bob who was confused,""When 
  I was scooping the ice cream there were no 
  worms."" ""Whatever, but, by the way. I'm not 
  coming back to your house anymore. I've 
  got better things to do,"" Zoe angerily replied 
  before storming out the door. On the way 
  out, she drops the bowl, and worms 
  suddenly starts crawling out. ""Weird, I only 
 was away for 5 seconds to put away the 
               the 
 ice cream and ^ scooper thing,"" said Bob. 
 For a week at a summer camp that they 
 had together, Zoe ignored Bob. After the 
 summer camp ended, Bob recieved texts from 
 Zoe, but it wasn't that pleasant. It was 
 angry, mean texts saying that Bob had no 
  more friends because Bob had gotten into 
                                           5206
                   because Zoe had told Bob
                      her password
 Zoe's social media^. ""I didn't do that!"" exclaimed 
Bob when she pieced the story together. 
When they all got back to school in the fall, 
Bob was iced out, but she went up to Zoe 
to say that she didn't hack into Zoe's 
accound, but Zoe only replied, ""I'll believe you, but 
you need to find the person who did it, and tell 
them that I won't be mad."" Zoe's friend 
Grace stood up and said,"" Zoe, no need to 
be mad at Bob, it was me who hacked 
into your account because I didn't want you 
to be hanging out with Bob so much, I 
wanted to hang out with you more. I'm 
really sorry. Oh! By the way, I overheard you

 I woke up. Today we were exploring a pond for 
 science class; the pond will have things like 
 worms, leeches, and bug larva. I am terrified of worms. 
 My friends always tease me about it and show 
me pictures of them. I really want to stay 
home. Sundenly I get a great idea, I will 
 pretened I am sick. My parents are not up yet 
 so I boil hot water and soak a washcloth 
 in it. Then i put it on my forhead so it 
 feels hot. I hear footsteps in the hallway. My 
  mom appears in my room.""I dont feel well,"" 
I mumble, ""Ok,"" my mom said, ""Let me check 
your temperature."" ""Wow you have a feaver."" In my 
 head I was terrifed I would get caaght, 
 but I said ""Can I stay home from school?"" 
 I slept the whole day. Later after my 
 siblings got home I told my mom what 
 happened; she got very mad at me and 
 I got grounded. The next day at school:

One day the Sun came up. Sun 
was a very stoic and happy feeling. 
 Sun represented light when it 
was dark or as some people 
would say a nice day when Sun 
shined. It was 9:00 in the 
morning and Moon rose. ""It is 
not time for you to rise and take

not get enough time in the Sky! 
You always get all of the []

have more time in the

so more people can sleep longer"", 
said Wind. After wind made 
his statement there was a big

                     named Timothy Browns
There once was a boy ^ who lived in a cottage 
in a large forest. One day he told his mother, ""I'm going 
to take a walk in the forest. ""Yes, you may do as 
you wish,"" his mother replied. Timothy wondered what he would 
come by on this adventure. As he strolled through the forest 
Timothy found something he never noticed. A large cave 
sat in the side of a boulder. Timothy, being a curious 
wanderer, ventured into the mysterious new cave After 
walking around for a minute or two, Timothy came uon a 
small cavern crowded by rocks on the ground. But there 
was something else about this cavern. A blue glow was 
coming from . the walls and floating around the room. 
It was bonding to the rocks and made them 
seem like they were hovering off the ground. Timothy 
wanted to see what this magical force was doing.So 
he got on his knees and picked up one of the 
rocks. It felt lighter than most rocks. Suddenly, 
The rock flew out of timothy's hand and hit 
  an other rock. Then like a tornado all the rocks spun 
around and all cane together. When the dust settled, 
in front of Timothy was a rock figure. With blue 
 glowing eyes and two small rock ears. He said, ""Hi, I am"" 
then it paused and said, ""I don't have a name."" Timothy 
marvled at the new creaure he had discovered. ""Woah."" 
They becane friends but Timothy couldn't think 
 of a name eventually he naned him Rocky.",Photo 5210.jpg

   I walk into the Crying Boy Tavern, my 
sword hung over my shoulder. ""Here's your 
souvenir,"" I say as I put the claw of 
Supreme Warlord Slog-Dog, the kind of 
orcs, onto a table. ""So the beast is dead,"" 
my buyer says. ""Didn't stand a chance 
against the Sword of Souls,"" I answer. 
"" I'll give you one more task, slay the 
treant that lurks in the bottom of 
the midnight's hole,"" my buyer tells 
me. ""Whatever,"" I say back. He opens 
a portal and I walk through, in front 
of me lies one tree. I approach it 
and it comes to life. ""Who dares to come 
into the midnight's hole?"" the treant 
asks. ""Let's make this quick,"" I say, 
""either you give me one of your branches 
or I take it with force."" ""Little hero, 
you have no chance against me,"" he says 
as he swings his mighty arm. ""I'm guessing 
Heinzd'all sent you,"" the tree booms. ""Who 
is Heinzd'all?"" I ask. ""Your buyer, 
he is a demon from the very depths of 
this hole."" ""Enough of this!"" I shout. 
I launch myself off of a rock and 
frantically swing my sword. Surprisingly, 

he counters every blow. ""That's not 
possible!"" I howl. ""Don't trust your 
buyer, or else he will betray you just 
as he betrayed many others!"" the tree 
booms. ""How did he betray them?!"" I 
loudly ask. ""He sent them here with 
the Sword of Souls, he knew the curse 
and knew the heroes would die,"" the beast 
continues, ""look at the skeletons 
here!"" ""My buyer is a kind man, he 
works at orphanages and clears the 
land of horrible monsters!"" I shout 
back. "" Sadly you are incorrect, now it 
is time for you to meet the others!"" 
he howls as he strikes. I roll to 
the side, but he is prepared. He grabs 
me and I go up. ""Now you meet your 
end, little hero,"" he keeps talking, ""The 
buyer's evil drive caused him to 
tell you you had a chance, but he was 
lying, he is trying to kill you!"" ""You 
are not correct!"" I scream as I leap 
from his clutches and jab my sword 
deep into his wooden head. ""You are the 
one to..."" his voice getting softer, seeming 
as though every word is more challenging
                                        5213
than the last, ""defeat me."" As the 
now lifeless treant falls to the ground, 
I wonder about the argument we just 
had. The tree was ready, the skeletons 
were everywhere, but my buyer never gave 
me the Sword of Souls. What was 
the tree talking about? These thoughts 
still did not leave my head as I 
walked through the portal to get back 
to the Crying Boy Tavern. When my 
buyer, apparently named ""Hei'nzd'all"" saw 
me, he nearly jumped into orbit. ""E-Eric, 
you survived!"" he stuttered. ""You sent 
me to my death!"" I yelled a little 
too loud. ""N-no, I-I-I kn-n-new y-y-you 
were to t-to the ch-ch-challenge,"" he 
sounded terrified. ""I'm not letting you 
hurt anyone else,"" I said as I 
raised my sword. ""N-n-n-noooooooo!"" 
he shouted as I brought it down. 
""Keep the money, and I'll keep both 
my and your lives,"" I was done with 
monster hunting, my buyer was no more, 
and no one would be terrorized by 
the evil treant that lived in the 
bottom of the midnight's hole.

 One average Saturday morning, John woke up. 
 He did what he did every morning, put 
 on his clothes, walk downstairs and eat 
 breakfast. It was a sunny day 
 outside and he wanted to go to the 
  park with his dog Bailey. John asked 
his mom if they could both go to 
 the park for a while. She agreed and 
 off they went. John attatched Bailey 
 to a leash. John brought a ball and 
 a rope to play with Bailey. As they 
 aproached the park, John saw something 
  gloring in the sun in the distance. 
 It was about 100 metres away. John 
 tried to stop and look at it, but 
  Bailey kept on pulling him away. John 
 redirected Bailey to the direction of 
 the light. But Bailey did not budge. 
 It was then when John relized that 
 Bailey wanted a burger that was 
 dropped near the enterance of the park. 
 John kept on pulling but then Bailey 
 did something unusual. He sat down 
 and did a gesture to go home. It

 shout, ""We did it boys!"" Sam looked at 
 me and smiled, ""Time to take Berlin.""  ",Photo 5215 pg3.jpg

  have to jump through a ring of fire. 
 The finish line wasn't far ahead. 
 Everyone's hearts were beating very

  catches up. And the race is

 Once upon a time, Alex, the tabby cat and 
Grace, the golden retiver were best friends 
under the same roof and never fought. 
They would go outside together, they would 
play tug-o-war together , got wet together, 
and got love equally by their owners together. 
One day their owners, Steven and Abby, split 
up. When Grace found this out she immediately 
told Alex, ""Alex! Alex!"" she said, ""I heard Steven and 
Abby saying they are going to split up!"" 
Alex responded, ""Are you sure you heard them 
right?"" ""100% sure!"" Grace said. ""They also said that 
Steven will take me and Abby will take 
you Alex!"" exclaimed Grace. This shocked Alex so 
much she had to lie down for a minute! 

  The day that they split up Alex and Grace 
made a plan. They each brought two photos 
of the other owner, they would place the 
photo in the kitchen in the morning and 
one photo in their bed at night. Alex had 
figured out that where she would be 
staying wasn't far from here, where Grace 
and Steven would stay.

to think our plan wouldn't work!"" 
""You know they say a picture's worth 
1,000 words,"" Alex said. 

  A month later they had met up 
several more times even without the 
pets! Then before you knew it they were 
living together again!

One day, in a land called Norock, 
 there were two friends. The wizard's 
 daughter, Amelia. And her cat, Phil. This 
 cat was not a normal cat, he could 
 talk. Amelia was a lonely girl because 
 her mother died and her father is 
 very depressed with her death. Phil was 
 her only friend. ""Wake up!"" said Phil. ""You 
 must hurry, or we will be late to breakfast, 
 the only time you see your father."" Amelia 
  rolled over and stared at the ceiling. 
 ""I refuse to go anywhere until you tell me 
 how mother died,"" she said. ""I can't, for 
 that is a secret that will never be told,"" 
 replied Phil. She groaned. Phil sighed and 
 said, ""Please eat with your father."" ""I said 
 NO!"" Phil was shocked and said, ""As your 
 pet, I refuse to be treated that way.""
  ""Fine, I don't need you anyway!"" she responded. 
 Phil walked out of her room and slammed 
 the door. ""I'll find out what happened myself,"" 
 she muttered. Phil ran as fast as possible 
 to the wizard. He reached the wizard's 
 room and paused. With hesitation, he knocked. 
 ""Enter,"" said a dark, low voice. ""Your wizardness,"" 
Phil stammered, ""your daughter is desperate and 
determined. I see the fiery determination in her eyes."" 
Page 2                          5219
 ""I feared this would happen one day,"" 
 said the Wizard. He turned around and 
 said, ""You fear me, but not me only. 
 Some thing is bothering you. What is it?"" 
 Phil said with a sigh,"" Amelia deserted me."" 
 Phil burst into tears. The wizard replied, ""
 How is that possible?"" Phil, still crying, said, 
 "" She is too determined to find the 
 truth."" The wizard dreaded this but he 
 feared Amelia would turn to the dark side 
 without this. ""Then we must tell her,"" said 
 the wizard. ""Oh, and call me Phillip."" he 
 added. Phil's jaw dropped. With a flick 
 of a wand, Phil froze. The wizard knocked 
 on Amelia's door. ""Go away, Phil!"" came her 
 voice. ""It's not Phil,"" replied her father. 
 She allowed him and frozen Phil to 
 enter. Phillip sat on the bed and said, 
 ""I hope you're ready."" Amelia immediately 
 knew what he was talking about. An hour 
 later, Amelia said, ""I had no idea."" ""Phil, I'm

""You must do it. You must track down the 
giant.""
   That was my father's last words to 
me, before I was kicked out of the palace, 
into the outside wilderness. Let me 
explain. My name is Tony Kane, and 
my Father is the King of Astenia. 
 We had been arguing over if I should 
 go out to find the famous giant, Sleth. 
 We have never captured him before, and 
 naturally my father wanted him. 
 He told me that I should capture Sleth, 
 to prove to the Astenians that I should 
 become the king after he would die. 
I, on the other hand, did not want this, 
 but my father did not care. At all. 
  Now I was feeling I had been abandoned 
  to get a silly prize my father wanted to 
  brag about. I hated it. But now, I felt 
 an anser; one that filled up with a 
 desire to capture Sleth, and to prove 
 to my father that I was better than 
being abandoned. But I decided that I 
 Should prove my worth to the Asterians 
 by helping them with their own 
 problems. After all, Sleth was not 
  bothering them. []
     Page 2                   5220
 So, for the next ten years, my father 
 didn't hear a single word from me. 
  I kept on helping each Asterian, 
 going from door to door, day and night. 
I helped each family out with their 
 biggest struggle, in exchange for 
 a promise: don't tell the king anything. 
 After the ten years, I came back 
 to the palace, to the same door that 
 I had gotten kicked out from. 
 I knocked on the door, and 2 seconds 
  later, a guard came. When he saw 
  me, he stared. Slowly, his eyes widened 
  when he realized who was standing 
  there. He called for the king to 
  come, and all of a sudden, I saw 
 my father but in a different way from 
 10 years ago. His hair was turning 
 gray, he had more wrinkles. But I 
 didn't care. Despite all of the 
 resentment from 10 years ago, I hugged 
  him with all my might. I still loved 
  him, even if he had kicked me out. 
  He was right, though. I did need 
  the Astenians respect, and by those 
   10 years, I think I earned theirs. 
   But my father's response was not []
      Page 3                    5220
 what I thought it would be. 
 ""Where's Sleth?"" he asked. 
 Apparently he didn't care if I 
  was here or not. But when I 
  explained what had happened, his 
  scowl at the beginning of my 
  explination slowly turned into a 
   chuckle at the end. 
     ""I'm amazed. You earned the 
 Astenians respect, like I told you 
 too,"" he said. ""Even though you 
 did not capture Sleth, you still have 
 my respect. You did a great job.""

""Mom I'm going out with my friend 
 Star to walk and jog a while."" ""Is that 
okay,"" I shout. She awnsers yes. So 
I quickly go to get my running sneakers 
and walk to my neighbor Star's house. She 
is playing outside. I tell her why I'm here. 
We both go inside of her house. She asks 
her mom ""Can I hang with Taylor for a 
while."" Her mom awnsers, ""Sure honey just 
be back by 7:00. Star and I both go 
out jogging about a mile and a half. We then 
just walk and talk for a while. I talk with 
her about School and her sports. She tells me 
that she has this huge gymnastics 
 competition coming up. It's called Nationals. 
She's a level 10 gymnast in USAG, so I 
expect her to do well on it. For about an 
hour we continue to walk and talk. I have 
a track competition coming up So this was 
a great time to practice. After we finish 
talking for a while we hear some 
music. It sounds catchy. I remember it. 
It's from the ice cream truck. It's a 
couple corners away. Luckily I have 10 dol[]s 
in my fanny pack. As we approch the 
truck there is a long line. We wait in till 
out turn. I order a snow cone and so does 
                        page 2  5223
Star. Mine is jolly rancher flavor though. 
Yum. This is so delectoble. I can feel 
the sweetness stretching across my 
throat. I make sure that I don't waste 
a drop. Star and I start to head 
back to both of our houses. As were 
jogging back we hear sirens. They get 
louder and louder. A this point were about 
a corner away from my house. Ambulances 
and firetrucks are going towards my 
house. all of a sudden my heat is trembling 
with fear. My palms are sweaty. There's 
a fire at my house. How would that be. 
So many thoughts are rushing through 
my head. The first thing I do is breathe. 
Second I spot Star's family. There waiting 
for her. I tell Star she can join them. I 
head to a firemen and say ""Where's my 
family."" He awnsers ""There still in the house."" 
I start sobbing. My face is like it was 
just drenched from rain. I know I have 
to save my mom and dog. I dash 
into my house.t scatter everywhere. Finally 
I find her. We are both covered in smoke 
and were coughing so hard. I bring her out 
of the house, I still remember ny dog 
cocoa. I tell my mom, ""I need to go back 
            page 3            - 5223
                                []
into that house."" Before she could stop 
me I dash into the house. I dash faster 
then any of my track competitions. 
I look everywhere. I still can't find 
cocoa. There I spot him. He's in the 
bathroom. I feel like I'm about to 
die. There's no way out now. I quickly 
run to my bedroom, and all I can 
spot is a window. Luckily theres a 
ladder. I step on it, but it just 
drops. I have an idea a throw dawn 
my super long blanket. My mom ties 
it to something that is super stray. 
I tie myself to the blanket and 
I slide down. I made it I'm out. 
The best part is I'm out alive 
and so was my family. I felt 
so good of what I did. I was 
super proud to be a hero.

 go visit your mom. Then, you will be roaming around

 dragons were solitary creatu[]s, demestication did 
 something to Draco. Sebastian just lost his

got better at living without sebastion. The week past 
 and it was time for phase two of The Plan. Draco moved 
 back into the human world. The stairs did not 
  feel good. It made him want to go back, but 
  he trusted Ssebastion. After the first few days, Draco 
  startd ignoring the looks. Sure they kept coming but il

riptied Lions. Bob was one of the 
fiecest papwhals. Papwhals are 
a mix of puppies, pizzlies, bats, and 
narWhals. Bob was sure he wasgoing 
to win it for his team and 
take over the jungle. But, there were 
two creatures that were standing 
in his way. The first one was the 
Demon King that tries to kill you 
when you pass the half way mark. 
The other one are the Lionis, Lionis Riptide. 
Lionis was a little older than Bob. The 
 reason he hate Lionis is because when 
 Bob was younger his mom went out to 
hunt. But at that time the papwhals 
and the Riptide Lions had piece but 
then, ""Ahh!!"" Bob's fathe'r ranout 
 and she was gone. Bod had seen a Riptide 
Lion speeding away. Bod though ist was 
Lionis so ever since then he wanted 
to kill Lionis. Now he just live with 
his father Tidus. So he is training. 
                                          5225
Then he saw Lionis and his team. 
Lionis said, ""Hello Bob."" Bod replided ""Hey... Bad"" 
""So, did you train for the bigboy games?"" 
Said Lionis ""Ha of coarse I did."" ""OK then 
 best of luck to you."" ""Same to you."" 
 Then came flying in from the sky, 
 a very pretty papwhal.

 Once upon a time, there was a beetle clan named the Artemites. The 
 Artemites lived in a big tree in a jungle. Now, there was a rival clan 
 named the Kaydites. The Kaydites lived in the tree next to it. Since 
 they lived in the same area, they fought often for the land. They 
would send armies and everything. In both of these respected clans []ero
two young beetles named Michael and Jean. They had been taught 
 to fight the other, but secretely sought peace. They both 
 were very skilled fighters and were in the army. One day, the 
 tow came across each other during an encounter. ""You fight well,"" 
Jean said. ""You as well,"" replied Michael. These boys deliberately tried 
as hard as they could to avoid killing off the enemy. As the 
encounter ended and they were leaving, they had som parting words. 
""You're like me. You seek peace, don't you?"" said Michael. ""I do,"" replied 
Jean, ""Follow me, I know a pathway where we can talk more."" 

When the boys headed down the path and into the hole, nobody 
saw them. ""So, what is your name?"" asked Michael. ""Jean. And 
 you?"" replied Jean. ""Michael,"" responded Michael. ""Look, I know this 
sounds crazy, but we must find peace,"" said Michael. ""Are you insane?! 
 We cannot overthrow the clans."" ""We must. Are you really 
 ready to give up your dream?"" ""Fine,"" said Jean, ""We'll give 
 it a try."" 

 Over the course of a month they met in the same 
 place everyday. but one day, when their plan was ready, 
they waited for the next encounter. Their plan was 
                                                    5227
 to spread a scent that puts everyone in the area to sleep. 
 They release the scent they had been working on for months 
and... BOOM! The gas exploded. 

When all the beatles woke up, the boys went up to explain 
their idea. The commanders from their respective clans agreed. 
Peace was made! The boys were speechless. They saved their 
 clans! 

 The clans never fought again and the boys went on to 
 be lifetime friends.

with his friends. Billy's friends do not really like Jerry, so when 
they saw Jerry, they ran away, but Billy walked up to Jerry and 
said, ""Would you like to play with us?"" When Jerry heard the question 
he was so happy. Billy and Jerry went to Billy's friends and said, 
""Let's play!"" Billy's friends took Billy to the side and murmured, 
""No way we're playing with him!"" Billy whispered back, ""Fine we don't 
have to play with him, but what about giving him at least one chance."" 
They screamed back at him, ""NO!!"" 

Billy and his friends walk up to Jerry and they all give their 
opinion. Billy's friends went first. They said things like, ""You are 
selfish, annoying, and mean!"" Jerry almosst cried but he kept 
himself together. Jerry screamed ""Fair enough!"" and ran away. 
Billy did not know what to say so he followed his friends. 
Billy's friends found Jerry crying. Jerry said, ""Leave me alone."" 
Billy's friends started to scream, ""Cry baby! Cry baby!"" 
Jerry screamed at them, ""Why are you picking on me?!"" They 
said, ""You are so weak!"" Jerry threw his thorns at them.

bit sick. I was freaking out. I did not 
know what to do. I asked myself, 
""Does he need to go to the vet?"" 
I didn't think so. I just thought 
it was normal. The day after, he 
was throwing up and everything. I 
knew something was wrong. 

  The next day, I asked the vet, 
""Can I go to you? My dog is 
 having a big problem with its 
  stomach. It was throwing up 
 and even pooping all over the place. 
 He could do better than that."" I 
 brought him to the vet. The vet said, 
""Your dog has a stomach bug. He could die. 
It is hurting him and making him go wild. 
 It is even leading him to not 
 be potty trained anymore."" I 
 was worried. The vet did all 
 he could to cure the dog. The 
  next day, I went to see if 
 the dog was okay. The vet said, 
 ""It will take approximately a 
   month for him to recover."" I 
  took him back home. []

 no reason. I have done nothing

 not yet.) I saw a few people like

 I think someone called prison. 
 there were were also humans behind 
  bars. I yelled at the 
 gaurd, ""Get your hands off me!"" 
 the gaurd just said ""no,"" and put me 
 in my cell. Great, but great I 
 thought to myself. ""How am I going

 myself. A few days more in

 why not just go through the

   One day, a quarrel broke out 
between a dolphin and a human over 
who was smarter. 
   ""I can communicate with my peers 
 and I've taken over more than half of 
 the world,"" the human bragged. 
    ""And you really think that's a good 
 thing?"" the dolphin sneered. ""First of all, you 
are currently DESTROYING the environmnet 
and ruining the land, not to mention that 
you have caused the endangerment or 
extinction of hundreds to thousands of 
 species. Also, the underwater world still 
 remains largely untouched by you. Do 
 you have a settlement down there? 
 Yeah, I didn't think so."" 
   The human turned bright red in 
the face. He spluttered, ""W-well, y-you, 
think you're s-so smart, but I'm s-smarter!"" 
   The dolphin replied, ""Then how about 
we have a contest? We'll have two judges: 
 a human and a dolphin, to be fair."" 
   The human and the dolphin were now 
face-to-face. The human told the dolphin, 
"" You're on.""

 had amassed as the news spread. 
    The dolphin judge the[] shaited, ""First, the 
race on land. Then, the race in water.

    ""Let's go,"" the dolphin and human said. 
    The horn blared for the beginning 
of the land race. The human took off, 
leaving the dolphin struggling on the 
ground. Five minutes later, the human 
crossed the finish line one kilometer away 
while the dolphin had barely gained one 
meter. 
   ""The human wins! 1-0, humans!"" 
The human announcer yelled, prompting huge 
applause from the humans in the crowd. 
""Now, for the waer race!"" 
   The story was very much 
the opposite. the dolphin swam quickly, getting 
                                  5234
 to the finish line in a few minutes 
 while the human flailed helplessly. 
    ""I don't know how to swim! he 
wailed. 
    ""Aaaand, the dolphin wins the 
 water race! 1-1, tie game!"" the dolphin 
 announcer announces as the dolphins cheer. 
 ""[]Now, for the food race!"" 
     "" The rules are simple,"" the 
human announcer announced. ""Whoever can 
 find, kill, and consume an animal first 
 will win!"" 
     The horn blared, but before they 
 could start, a brave woman raced 
 out onto the track. ""Wait!"" she 
 yelled.
      ""Why?"" asked the competitors. 
      ""Whot is the point of this?"" 
she demanded. ""We're all mammals! Why 
are we competing to see who's better?"" 
    The two competitors looked at 
  each other in confusion. Then, the dolphin 
  said sheepishly, ""Er... we don't really 
  know."" 
       ""Then stop this nonsense!"" The 
 woman yelled. ""You're just wasting energy!"" 
                                     5234
    ""Ymm.. okay,"" they said, 
 shaking hands. The crowd roared 
 with approval. The races were called 
 off, and they walked back, to their 
 respective homes, the dolphin told the 
 human, "" Well, there's one advantage, 
 you have over me."" 
       ""What?"" the human asked. 
       ""Well, I don't have opposable 
 thumbs. Or hands, for that matter."" 
       They smiled and walked off 
into the sunset.

who was smarter. 
   ""I can communicate with my peers

we have a contest? We'll have two judges: 
 a human and a dolphin, to be fair.""

""5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1, ready or not here I come!"" screamed Hanah. 
I was rushing for a place to hide. My eyes crossed the 
closet, I pushed open the door, ""You snooze you lose!"" snickered 
James. I saw the cabinet, I sprinted across the 
creaky wooden floors. ""Find somewhere else!"" 
whispered Jessica. This was my time, my place to 
shine, I raced into the basement. This was my 
chance to show my siblings that I could be 
just as great as them at hide and seek. I 
stepped in the basement, and closed my eyes. I was 
always afraid of the dark. I stepped into the 
doorway, and then from there, I fell into the 
darkness. 

   It felt like I would fall forever, there 
was a sudden thud as I fell to the ground. 
 It was pitch black, other then a speck of light. 
I ran and ran towards the speck of light. It 
was a door, a golden door. It was paved with 
jewels of all different colors. I opened it, and 
 I walked through, a whole new word appeared 
in front of my eyes. I looked back and the 
door faded. 

   A creature like thing whipped past me, ""I'm 
late! I need to go!"" it hollered. I looked ahead, 
                                   5235
 it seemed to be a gathering. A honk filled 
the air. Someone was blowing a horn. A tall 
woman rised into the air, her hair was pulled 
back tightly into a bun. I saw the creature again, 
it was a camel, with a neck of an ostrich, and 
 two ears of a fennec fox. I ran over to the 
 meeting, I hid behind a large rock. ""Do you 
 love me?"" The tall girl bellowed. The group 
screamed yes. It seemed as if the creature 
wasn't into it, the creatures didn't even say 
yes. ""You,"" the women pointed to the creature, ""guards, 
get him! He dares not to scream for me!"" 
""No, no, I do love you, you are our belved 
queen!"" He was pushed out of the gathering. 
 I rushed over to him,""Hi, my name is Caroline,"" 
 I whispered. ""You, you are the only one who 
can save us from this cruel queen,"" he said. 
""Sorry, me?"" I asked. ""Yes, you. My name is 
Ben,"" he said. ""You are the only one who can 
save us. You must take down our Queen Ethol. 
Your mother was the queen back in the day. She 
was the most prized possesion of our kingdom. 
She ruled with peace and love, until her sister 
was revealed the older of the two. Your aunt 
then became queen."" Ben explained. ""You knew 
my mother?"" I asked. ""Everyone knew your 
mother,"" he said. 
                                   5235
 ""What must I do to save everyone. My 
mother always told me that violence wasn't 
the answer."" I said. ""You must make her feel 
ashamed, that's what she hates the most!"" 
Ben exclaimed. ""But I know nothing about her! 
 I don't know how to make her feel ashamed. I 
said. ""Just think, she is your aunt after all,"" 
 said Ben. She is ashamed of something, ""All 
 I know is that she was jealous of her sister."" 
 I thought back to my childhood, a sudden 
 image popped into my head. It was of my 
 mother and the queen casting a spell. I ran 
over to the gathering, ""You are ashamed of 
your sister!"" the whole crowd gasped. 
 ""You can't cast a spell, and my mother can!"" 
 The queen chased after me. I screamed 
for the guards, ""don't listen to her! Be free!"" 
 I said. The guards grabbed the queen, 
 Ben thanked me. A golden door popped up 
 in front of me, I stepped in, waving good-
 bye to all of my subjects. I was back to 
 the staircase where it had all begun.

get him! He dares not to scream for me!"" 
""No, no, I do love you, you are our belved 
queen!"" He was pushed out of the gathering. 
 I rushed over to him,""Hi, my name is Caroline,"" 
 I whispered. ""You, you are the only one who 
can save us from this cruel queen,"" he said. 
""Sorry, me?"" I asked. ""Yes, you. My name is 
Ben,"" he said. ""You are the only one who can 
save us. You must take down our Queen Ethol. 
Your mother was the queen back in the day. She 
was the most prized possesion of our kingdom. 
She ruled with peace and love, until her sister 
was revealed the older of the two. Your aunt 
then became queen."" Ben explained. ""You knew 
my mother?"" I asked. ""Everyone knew your 
mother,"" he said. 
                                   5235
 ""What must I do to save everyone. My 
mother always told me that violence wasn't 
the answer."" I said. ""You must make her feel 
ashamed, that's what she hates the most!"" 
Ben exclaimed. ""But I know nothing about her! 
 I don't know how to make her feel ashamed. I 
said. ""Just think, she is your aunt after all,"" 
 said Ben. She is ashamed of something, ""All 
 I know is that she was jealous of her sister."" 
 I thought back to my childhood, a sudden 
 image popped into my head. It was of my 
 mother and the queen casting a spell. I ran 
over to the gathering, ""You are ashamed of 
your sister!"" the whole crowd gasped. 
 ""You can't cast a spell, and my mother can!"" 
 The queen chased after me. I screamed 
for the guards, ""don't listen to her! Be free!"" 
 I said. The guards grabbed the queen, 
 Ben thanked me. A golden door popped up 
 in front of me, I stepped in, waving good-
 bye to all of my subjects. I was back to 
 the staircase where it had all begun.

     Lynda's Part of the Story
  Hello. my name is Lynda and I live a very unusual 
life. My family is gone, I was alone, and I'm a 
wereworld. Let me tell you my story. 
  It was a dark windy night with my family 
in our hut. It was just another gloomy 
night. I was hungry, so I left our hut 
 to get some berries. When I came back 
 a nightmare came to life. 
   I was watching my family of werewolves 
getting kidnapped by humans. They weren't 
killed. however they were getting pushed into a 
 truck. The last thing I remember was my 
 mom mouthing the words run. The humans 
 turned my way. That was the fastest I 
 had ever run in my life. 

      Mark's part of the story 
   Hi, [] my name is Mark. I 
am a hunter of all the werewolves. This may 
sound cruel but let me tell you my story. 
   I was just a kid at the time but my parents 
were away on a business trip. I was with my 
 grandma who I loved dearly. One day I found 
                  on the porch 
 my grandma crying ^ and asked her what 
 was wrong. She looked surprised to see me there 
 but reluctantly said, ""Your parents are gone."" 
                                        5236
 For a while that never registered with me 
but when I finally understood I became 
curious. What happened on the night of their 
death? One day I found the courage to 
ask. My grandma never hid anything from me 
but she did this once. She only said one 
word to me, ""Werewolves."" That was the 
day I decided all werewolves had to die. 
 None should be forgiven. 

     Lynda's Part 
  I settled down and started weeping. 
How could this happen. I stayed there for 
a while when someone picked me up. They 
 took me into their house where I continued 
 weeping. I didn't know what was happening 
 all I knew was that they were a human. 
 I continued to scratch untill they gave 
 me a pill I fell asleep within seconds. 

     Mark's Part
   I became a hunter of all wolves. The 
dangerous and the small. Not a single one 
could be innocent. They all were bad is 
what I told myself. I then [] went 
home to hear crying upstairs. I didn't 
                               5236
     []
 have ^ [] little sibling. I wondered 
who this was. 

    Lynda's part 
   I woke up from my slumber to an old 
lady smiling at me. I started scratching 
at her but she held me tight. ""Calm 
 down,"" is what she said. I started to 
 trust her. 

    Mark's Part 
   I went upstairs into my house and 
 saw no one. Not even my grandma but 
 the noise had stopped. One thing I 
 noticed however is that their was 
 a ladder leading up to the ceiling. I 
 climbed up to a terrifying sight. 

     Afterwards I s 
   Mark went up and saw his Grandmother 
cradling a small Werewolf. I freaked 
out. ""Grandmother what are you doing?!?"" 
I talked with them both and found out 
not all werewolves are bad. Some are 
good like this poor one. []

   [] [] Ending                 5236
  Now Lynda and Mark are married. 
The Grandmother helps them take care 
of their hybrid child Stella. They 
all love each other.[][] The 
world went to peace between people 
and werewolves.

   ""Help! Help!"" a voice shouted from beyon the 
canyon. I was puzzled if I should investigate 
at such a time. Before my mother passed 
she told me to always use my best judgment. 
But I wanted to help whomever 
was calling in such terror. I lept up 
from my ditch and carfully crept to 
where the screaming was coming from. 
   ""Help! Please!"" screamed the girl. She was 
trapped under a bolder. I quickly found a 
large stick and lifed the rock as much 
as I could to open it. She lept 
out. She was Covered in bruises and cuts 
but the first thing I noticed was that 
she was human. What was she doing on our 
side? 
   ""Thank you so much, you saved my life!"" 
she hugged me and ran across the 
canyon and into the deep forest, Should 
I have helped her? What would my 
father think? I decided to walk home 
and tell my sister floral.

floral tell him?

As bad as this may seem I want 
you to know he always spoke to 
me as this. And he always forgets. By

And I got to meet the girl again. 
Her name is Maya. 

   ""Hi, Im Maya. I was the girl who you 
saved! Thank you again!"" 

  She was very energetic. We ended up

  Life or death. Kill or be killed. That's

 the declining quantity of food that we had. 
 We didn't have a choice. We were born into it. 
If we wanted to eat, we fought. 
 It was the battle of the birds. 
Falcons vs. eagles. []
It started witha diplomatic meeting: 
""How about I take the birds, and you take 
the mammals?"" asked the falcon, but the eagle 
was not content. He then brought the war 
to stage two, stealing food. This went on 
for years, until it finally lead to one side 
having to be extinct, and the other having the 
food. 
  The battle wus between the pergrine 
falcon, and the harpee eage, two representatives 
from their sides. The falcon tried to reason 
with the harpee eagle, but to no avail. After 
a nearly fatal strike from the eagle's large 
talons, the falcon finally struck back. ""Don't 
make me do it,"" he warned, but then he climbed 
in altitude until the air was to thin to go 
any further, he execute the world famous dive. 
   He dropped his wings, and heading beak first 
shot downwards. At the speed of a bullet he 
 hit the eagle right on the neck. That was the end.

I found you outside my house, in my yard, one wing 
bent, with some feathers missing. A soft coo emitted 
from your throat, and pity welled inside of me. 
""Don't worry,"" I told you. ""I'm here,"" I said. I 
cupped you in my hands. You were my treasure. 
I nursed you and fed you, and gave you a home. 
You were my best friends. I Knew you had to go 
 someday, but I brushed that thought aside. 
 ""Surely you will always be with me,"" I thought. 
 ""You are my only true friend."" You were with 
 me for the good times, and the bad times. You 
 grew bigger and healthier, and I knew it was 
 almost time to realse you from your cage. 
 I loved you so much, it hurt to think of you 
 leaving. I felt conflicted. I wanted you to be 
 free, but my greed and selfishness pinned me 
 down. ""I love you,"" I would whisper. But saying 
 that only made me sadder. Selfishness is some-
 thing all humans possess. I could not help it. 
 But eventually, I Knew the day had come. 
 I had to let you go. I took your cage to 
 my yard. The place where I found you. 
 ""You will always be my very, very best friend,"" 
 I whispered. ""I will always be by your side."" 
 Then, with one small movement of my hand,

I found you outside my house, in my yard, one wing 
bent, with some feathers missing. A soft coo emitted 
from your throat, and pity welled inside of me. 
""Don't worry,"" I told you. ""I'm here,"" I said. I 
cupped you in my hands. You were my treasure. 
I nursed you and fed you, and gave you a home. 
You were my best friends. I Knew you had to go 
 someday, but I brushed that thought aside. 
 ""Surely you will always be with me,"" I thought. 
 ""You are my only true friend."" You were with 
 me for the good times, and the bad times. You 
 grew bigger and healthier, and I knew it was 
 almost time to realse you from your cage. 
 I loved you so much, it hurt to think of you 
 leaving. I felt conflicted. I wanted you to be 
 free, but my greed and selfishness pinned me 
 down. ""I love you,"" I would whisper. But saying 
 that only made me sadder. Selfishness is some-
 thing all humans possess. I could not help it. 
 But eventually, I Knew the day had come. 
 I had to let you go. I took your cage to 
 my yard. The place where I found you. 
 ""You will always be my very, very best friend,"" 
 I whispered. ""I will always be by your side."" 
 Then, with one small movement of my hand, 
 you were set free. You flew away my treasure, a 
 free, healthy bird.

""But! ""I want to keep her!"" exclaimed 
 the little boy name Fred. ""No you can't!"" 
 shouted his mom. ""She is to much work for us."" 
 his mom told him. ""Yeah, then were will 
 Lilie go (dog), to the animal shelter?"" 
Fred asked, desperate now. ""Maybe we can find 
 somebody who will take her in."" said 
Fred's mom, who really didn't want a dog. 
""Yeah but I can take care of her, I 
can help, please?"" Fred was almost to tears 
 now. ""You said the same thing about 
 your hamster, and look how that turned up, 
I was doing all the work. his mom exclaimed. 
I am not ready to have a pet bigger and 
 a lot more work than a hamster. The 
 hamster was my limits! yelled his mom 
  getting angry now.""""How about 
 you go to school and ask people if they 
 want to take her, and maybe you might 
 see her again,"" suggested his mom. ""Fine,"" 
 grumbled Fredd. The next day at school 
 Fred started asking people. It was close to the 
  end of the day, and Fred was walking 
home, somebody asked if he could have Lilie. 
He and his parents had been looking for 
 that exact breed, and Lilie was the first

amazing if I were to go back in time

 be able to come back!"" I did not care

 them. The only problem was that to get to the 
 people they had to go through a magical but evil 
  forest. The forest was filled with demons 
 and monsters. They would have to fight 
 there way through. Now every super good fighter 
 has a gun and weapon storage in their house.

 basement and geared up. They grabbed 
 shotguns, and knives. Assault Rifles and grenades. 
 They grabbed smg's and RPGS. They loaded 
  them all up in a big truck along with the 
  goods and supplies. They started driving. It 
  was a four hour drive so when they would

  gave hard punches and one of the twins got 
  knocked out. It was Jamie. ""Oh your dead

  hopped back in the car and were on there way.

Hi, I'm Bob. My best friend's Zip. 
   We usually walk to school together. 
 Zip is a fast robot. He is the fastest thing 
  in our school, PS. 39. When we 
 walk to school he walks really fast. 
 Since I'm slow I cannot keep up very 
 well. []
   One day I ask, ""Zip, can 
  you walk any slower?""
   ""No,"" he says in a robotic way. 
   ""You're so selfish!"" I yell. He runs 
   away. That was our first fight. 
I was churlish. I wasn't kind. 
  I started to cry. He was my only 
friend. The next day he didn't come 
 to walk with me. I saw him with 
 J. C. Adamson. I was mad. This 
 time I learned what I have 
  to keep my cool. I didn't 
  yell. 
    At school I sat down next 
  to him.

  be your friend!"" said Zip

 One day, two friends were arguing over 

 what ice cream flavor they wanted 

 to eat and what topping. You see, 

 they were the type that wanted to 

 match, to be like twins. I guess that 

 they always did the same thing, 

 although it probably got a little 

 boring at times. Anyway, they were 

 arguing. I don't know their names, 

 so let's just call them 1 and 2. 

 Basically, 1 wanted vanilla ice cream 

 with sour gummy worms on top. 

 2 wanted mint ice cream with 

                              5245
 chocolate chips on top. Such a hard 

 decision! As I munched on my 

 ice cream, I watched them fight 

 over the flavor. Hey remember what 

 I said at the beginning, that they 

 matched? Well, they were even wearing 

 the same thing! I wonder what they do 

 on days that they couldn't see 

 each other. Back on topic. 

 ""We ALWAYS eat mint ice cream!"" 

 exclaimed 1. 

 ""No, always VANILLA!"" exclaimed 2. 

 It kept on going like this for 

                               5245
 awhile, until the storekeeper was 

 afraid there would be a physical 

 fight. Which is why they tried to 

stop the argument. Tried and failed. 

They argued and argued, and it 

seemed as if the fight would 

never end. I guess if that was 

the case, they probably wouldn't 

be friends for a while. Then, I thought 

that that would be a shame 

because what kind of 

best friends break up over

certainly. They argued and argued, and 

 for some reason, I found it 

 to be very interesting. I tried 

 to look away, with no sucess. 

 The Irealized my ice cream 

 was melting! I debated with 

 going back home, but decided 

 I just HAD to see the end 

 of the argument. Would there 
 
 be a conclusion? What if 

 they started hating each 

 other? Now I didn't know if I 

 wanted to go. Would there 

                             5245
 be violence? Hatred? Bad 

 possibilities began to fill my head. 

 All of this... over ICE CREAM. 

 If you actually read the entire 

 story and didn't skip ahead, 

 you're probably thinking, ""Sheesh. 

  All this over ice cream. ""But, you 

  don't know these kids. I went 

  to summer camp with them 

  before, (and promptly forgot their 
  
   names) and it was NOT good. Each 

  kid was SOOO selfish, it wasn't 

  even funny. Each wanted their own 

                              5245
  thing, and wouldn't give up. 

  I wanted to see the result of 

  this conflict. Usually, they went 

  half-and-half. But, our ice cream 

  shops were very picky. They didn't 

  allow half-and-half. Only full. 

  You could either get two seperate 

  full ones, or decide which. And 

  from what I head, they only 

  had enough for two. One for 

  each. They were either not going to 

  agree, or not have ice cream. 

  Then... the ICE CREAM CAME 

                              5245
   ALIVE!!! Everybody ran for their 

 lives, and so I guess they never 
  
  ice cream after all.

 One day, two friends were arguing over 

 what ice cream flavor they wanted 

 to eat and what topping. You see, 

 they were the type that wanted to 

 match, to be like twins. I guess that 

 they always did the same thing, 

 although it probably got a little 

 boring at times. Anyway, they were 

 arguing. I don't know their names, 

 so let's just call them 1 and 2. 

 Basically, 1 wanted vanilla ice cream 

 with sour gummy worms on top. 

 2 wanted mint ice cream with 

                              5245
 chocolate chips on top. Such a hard 

 decision! As I munched on my 

 ice cream, I watched them fight 

 over the flavor. Hey remember what 

 I said at the beginning, that they 

 matched? Well, they were even wearing 

 the same thing! I wonder what they do 

 on days that they couldn't see 

 each other. Back on topic. 

 ""We ALWAYS eat mint ice cream!"" 

 exclaimed 1. 

 ""No, always VANILLA!"" exclaimed 2. 

 It kept on going like this for 

                               5245
 awhile, until the storekeeper was 

 afraid there would be a physical 

 fight. Which is why they tried to 

stop the argument. Tried and failed. 

They argued and argued, and it 

seemed as if the fight would 

never end. I guess if that was 

the case, they probably wouldn't 

be friends for a while. Then, I thought 

that that would be a shame 

because what kind of 

best friends break up over 

an ice cream flavor?  Not mine, 

                                 5245

  this conflict. Usually, they went 

  half-and-half. But, our ice cream 

  shops were very picky. They didn't 

  allow half-and-half. Only full. 

  You could either get two seperate 

  full ones, or decide which. And 

  from what I head, they only 

  had enough for two. One for 

  each. They were either not going to 

  agree, or not have ice cream. 

  Then... the ICE CREAM CAME 

                              5245
   ALIVE!!! Everybody ran for their 

 lives, and so I guess they never 
  
  ice cream after all.

Once there was a boy. A boy ^ who had something very special 
about him. He could teleport to whereever he wanted to go. One 
day he went to school, and he came across Timothy, the bully of 
the school. Timothy started fighting Peter, until Peter decided to 
get out of there. He teleported. Peter didn't really know 
where he went when he teleported. But what he did know 
is that it was cold, it was snowing, and there was no sign of 
anything other than the coldness. Suddenly out of no where, 
Peter saw a big, dark shape coming toward him. He started 
running yelling ""help""""help!"" But nobody was there to help him. 
Finally Peter stopped running. He looked behind himself, and he 
found a huge, white tiger standing over his head. He 
screamed as loud as he could, but he was too tired to run. The 
tiger set its paws on the ground once again, and he looked 
into the eyes of the scared little boy. The tiger stepped 
closer, and then started to lick the boy's face. The boy 
started to pet the tiger, and he realized that the tiger was 
harmless. They became friend's, and the tiger showed Peter his home. 
They lived with each other for five years, and the tiger protected 
his boy. The boy names his tiger Strips. Then one day the boy 
thought of his real home. He wanted to go back. But he 
couldn't just leave Strips. So he took him home with him. 
When he teleported home, he still had to face the 
bully, Timothy. But don't worry, Strips chased him 
off.⎾   ⏋

""What?"" questioned Emma, ""my dog is going 
to die?"" Emma had a pug, not any pug 
but a magical pug. Dr. Williams said, ""Blue 
has 48 hours left to live."" Emma knew this 
was not true because Blue's magic was 
that he could never die, ever. The problem 
was nobody in the whole world who knew about 
Blue's powers. Emma could not tell the vet 
or else Blue would be taken away.

Emma had no other option but to just play 
along. What was there to do? Tell the vet, 
keep it a secret, do nothing. Emma played 
along with the doctor until it was time to 
go. In a panic Emma hid Blue in her closet. 
Why, who knows. 

She wanted it to seem like Blue died. 
72 hours after Emma went to the vet 
she got a knock at her door. ""Open 
up!"" exclaimed an unknown voice, ""we know what 
you did!"" Emma opened the door and she was 
startled to see Dr. Williams with 4 men 
dressed in black and sunglasses. All of them 
rush in without saying anything and go 
straight to the closet. 

                                    -5249

did they see. Blue on the floor dead.

Blue after they went to the vet. To 
this day nobody knows how Blue died.

 much I ask. My parents think that it's 
 such a big responsibility to take care of 
 a pet like a dog. But at least I'm 
 not longing for something so crazy 
 like my brothers. Their strongest 
 desire is to have a pet crocodile! 
 I know that they will never get one. 
 And that is a fact.                   1

   I just can't wait until I finally 
get my own dog, cat, goat, whatever 
it might be. I [] sat there, sucking 
on my bright blue popsicle, [] pondering. 
Half an hour passed, and [] suddenly, 
I had an epiphony. ""I got it!"" I 
[] hollered. My brothers came racing 
into the room. ""The plan?"" Jamie asked 
with a huge grin. Jamie is [] the oldest 
brother. He's a sophmore in high school 
and is 16.
      ""Yes,"" I replied. 
      ""Well, come on! The sooner [] you 
[] share it, the soon we can get it!"" 
exclaimed my other brother Carson. 
Carson is in Eight Grade. He's 14. 
    [] Reader, you are probably thinking: 
what could this plan be? [] Since 
last year, we've been planning a 
way to get our pet. 
    ""Ok, here it is: starting tomorrow 
 morning, at 8:00 a.m., we are telling 
[] Mom that we're meeting Jake 
in 
^[] the woods to explore the earth. []
                                     2
                             5250
And then we're-""
    ""Wait, hold on. Exploring bugs? That's 
ridiculous.

☆        The Clone Wars 
   Commandere Cragg was worried. His team had 
crashed into a bog on planet Denegar, and 
they seemed to be stuck. 
    He walked over to his trusted aide, 
Captain Zev. ""Any news?"" he asked.
    ""No.""
    The clones walked toward their smoking 
 escape pod. The charred husk of the pod reminded 
  the two of their dead brothers. Then the pod 
 carrying the clones had landed, only two 
 clones had made it out of the ill-fated 
 vessel. 
     Those two were Cragg and zev.

     ""RUN!"" Cragg shouted. He pushed his 
   men through a corridor as droids started 
 to pour in. He returned their fire until 
 forced to retreat. ""Go!"" 
     The clone [] divison - Reek, Seven, Ate, and 
 Deviss - ran. Cragg laid down covering fire until[]
it became too late. He sprinted with 
 his men. 
     They couldn't possibly know, but their 
 starship was about to blow. 
                             -5254 pg 2
  Outside, the droid ship Malevolence waited. 
On boar[] stood General Grievious. His skeletal, 
 imposing frame seemed to take up the 
 whole ship, and his rasping breath hinted 
 at a great evil within. 
        This was darkness. 
       Grievious ordered the ion cannons 
 to fire. They immediately knocked out 
 every single power[] source on the republic 
 ship. 
       The ship was doomed. 
       As the power cut off on the ship, 
 Cragg sighed. He hated to do this, but it 
 was clear it was the only way. 
       ""Abandon ship,"" he said. 
       They sprinted to the escape 
pods. 
       As they got there, they saw 
that the power there was out too. 
The only way to launch it was a 
manual lever - that had to be yanked 
by someone outside th pod. 
       Cragg resigned himself to his fate. 
""I'll do it,"" he said grimly ⎾                      ⏋
       The clones looked at 
Finally, [] clone trooper[] Ate
up. ""With all due respect, no⎿                      ⏌ 
       Cragg scowled under his helmet. 
       ""I'm commander here!"" 
       ""Which is why you [] can' die!"" retorted Ate.
       Cragg shook his head. ""Let me do this, soldier.
       You must go on for the Republic.""
       At nodded, resignedly. 
       As Crass prepared to launch the leverl, the clones got in, 
                                    - 5254 pg 3 
       [] Cragg started to push the lever - he never 
    got the chance.  
          Ate knocked him out with 2 well-
placed punch. 
          Ate sighed. ""Get him in."" Seven and Deviss 
 hauled him in. Captain Zev noaded with respect. 
          ""Good luck.""

   Commandere Cragg was worried. His team had 
crashed into a bog on planet Denegar, and 
they seemed to be stuck. 
    He walked over to his trusted aide, 
Captain Zev. ""Any news?"" he asked.
    ""No.""
    The clones walked toward their smoking 
 escape pod. The charred husk of the pod reminded 
  the two of their dead brothers. Then the pod 
 carrying the clones had landed, only two 
 clones had made it out of the ill-fated 
 vessel. 
     Those two were Cragg and zev.

 to pour in. He returned their fire until 
 forced to retreat. ""Go!"" 
     The clone [] divison - Reek, Seven, Ate, and 
 Deviss - ran. Cragg laid down covering fire until[]
it became too late. He sprinted with 
 his men. 
     They couldn't possibly know, but their 
 starship was about to blow. 
                             -5254 pg 2
  Outside, the droid ship Malevolence waited. 
On boar[] stood General Grievious. His skeletal, 
 imposing frame seemed to take up the 
 whole ship, and his rasping breath hinted 
 at a great evil within. 
        This was darkness. 
       Grievious ordered the ion cannons 
 to fire. They immediately knocked out 
 every single power[] source on the republic 
 ship. 
       The ship was doomed. 
       As the power cut off on the ship, 
 Cragg sighed. He hated to do this, but it 
 was clear it was the only way. 
       ""Abandon ship,"" he said. 
       They sprinted to the escape 
pods. 
       As they got there, they saw 
that the power there was out too. 
The only way to launch it was a 
manual lever - that had to be yanked 
by someone outside th pod.

The date ws April 24, 2047 at the planet 
 known as Mars. Leo is a martian and his best friend 
 is Max. They are the leader of the Martians. 
Mars is getting attacked by the dreadful 
Earthlings and are losing. Leo says, ""We must 
flee to Neptune. All our people will die."" 
The people all chant 13000 and are not 
 moving anywhere. Max says, ""We cannot move. 
 If the people do not like it, we probally 
 cannot dissuade them to."" One half an hour 
 later, the Earthlings came storming into the 
 Town Hall and said ""Give us all your valuables 
 or we will destroy everything."" At that moment 
 the people and Max realized what Leo was 
  talking about and said, ""We have to go! Get 
  in the escape pods and go!"" The Earthlings 
  chased the martians all the way to Jupiter, 
  and since Jupieter is a gas, the hid inside 
  the very dense gas, and while the Earthlings 
  were celebrating thinking that the Martians 
  had died, the Martians snuck out and lived 
  on Neptune.

John was walking along when he saw a big, juicy burger. 
 It was right next to a stream. John went to go get 
 the burger. As soon as he got near the burger, a frog jumped 
  out of the stream. John was holding the burger. He was 
  so scared, he fell into the stream with the burger. John wanted 
  to eat the burger because he was a very sanitary 
   man. Before he could take a bite, the frog said, ""Hey! 
  Why did you steal my burger?"" John was wet and cold 
   and he was very angry at the frog. He said, 
  ""I WANTED TO EAT THE BURGER!!!!""
 The frog, with his eyes open, said, ""Look man, you should have 
  asked."" John was enraged and he was upset that he 
   could not eat the burger so he kicked the frog and sent 
  him flying into the stream. Now this frog has had a pretty 
    bad day, some guy stole his burger and kicked him 
   into the stream. The frog, (who was very smart) called 
  up some clickens and asked them if they could get this 
  guy and start pecking him. The chickens came and started pecking 
  John. John climbed up a tree and belly-flopped into the water. 
  He searched for the frog. He found him and he apologized for 
  hurting the frog and offered to share the burger. He 
   agreed and they were all happy.        ",Photo 5260.jpg

Chickpea,2021-11-07 06:36:59,"The story of Mr. Fox         -  5263
One sunny evening in a forest there was 
a wolf and a Fox, the wolf's name was 
Holz, and the Fox's name was just Mr. Fox. 
They were best friends for very long until 
last year where Holz made Mr. Fox leave 
school with him and go to forests to hunt. 
Later on, Holz just bossed Mr. Fox around, 
Mr. Fox never complained or said anything 
to make Holz stop, but today, this evening, 
he will make Holz pay for what he 
did...
     Holz and Mr. Fox were ready to go to 
dinner, they were right next to a barn. 
""Check if there are anyone,"" Holz told Mr. Fox. 
He just answered with a nod and ran into 
the barn. The animals were locked inside 
a big barn house, luckily, there was 
a small hole to enter the house. After 
Mr. Fox went in, he was so excited. The 
barn was filled with sheeps and no 
human. 
""All checked,"" yelled Mr. Fox, ""come here!"" 
     Holze ran there as fast as he could 
and was impressed. They didn't talk at all 
and started eating. Every few seconds, 
Mr. Fox went throw the hole and check out-
side and came back. There and back, there 
                                    5263
and back. 
   Holz was curious so he asked, ""what are 
 you doing?"" 
  Mr. Fox answered, ""I... um... am just checking if 
anyone was here."" 
   Suddenly, A human came from the back door 
carrying a Moisin Nagat and a cane. Mr. Fox 
zipped throw the hole as fast as he could, 
but Holz was stucked at the hole because he 
ate way to much! That is when Holz realized 
that everytime when Mr. Fox went threw the 
door, he was trying to figure out how much 
to each more. The human shot Holz and died. 
Mr. Fox was more than happy. He was finally free...
