If you think there is 
more embaressing then 
me your wrong because 
there's no such thing 
as luck in my world. 
And somehow I became 
the coolest kid in school 
and the teachers pet. 
It all started on 
a normal day. "Swiettie 
come here girl," I said 
then I paused "Jessie 
stop spying on people". 
She look at me like I 
was crazy then hissed"
"I'm not spying someone 
just came out of the 
haunted house it gets 
worse every time you 
look at it." I said 
"that house was abandon 
   your 
for ^ information look," I 
opened the curtain I 
saw Swiettie then I 
saw a man walk 
out.

Next thing you know 
the lights turn off, 
I hear a scream. 
I reliziliaed it was 
Jessie. After that it 
blank Swiettie saved 
us and I was the 
coolest kid ever. I 
still don't know 
what happened but 
I'm cool for that.
