Once there was a dog and cat that lived together and were nice 
to each other until one day were there were both playing outside
and this happened...
"OMG, a squirrel" yelled Blister the dog as her ran after 
the furry rodent into the bushes of the yard.
"And he goes bozonkers again" said Lion the cat 
as he was playing with a toy mouse. 
"I didn't go bozonkers just 'cause I wanted to catch a 
squirrel while you just play with your dumb old mouse." 
Blister slightly shouted at his best friend. 
"You're the one who is for some reason alawys 
constantly chasing thocse poor old rodents," Lion 
shot right back at Blister. 
Then suddenly Blister jumped on Lion! 
"Get OFF me you incredibly bad dog!" Lion yelled at 
Blister. So he got off and went inside for some 
love. Lion on his tail. This weird because instead of 
a dog chasing a cat there was a cat chasing the dog! 
"Settle down" said the owner while seperating them. 
"How about we go for a walk" said the owner as 
he brought out a leash Blister jumped up and 
soon they were out walking around the block. 
"Phew" said Lion. 
"Now I get this whole place to myself" said Lion. 
When Blister got back he was still in a fight 
with Lion and then they thought that should only 
worry about themselfs and not each other's business.
