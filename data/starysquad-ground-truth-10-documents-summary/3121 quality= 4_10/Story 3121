       Hi my name is Grace, 
 I have a dog her name is Mary she 
 love to chase cats and loves treats.
            One day...
  "I see a cat," I said "I hope the dog 
  does not find it," said mom. I saw the 
  Mary run outside the next day and 
  I rubbed my eyes and there the 
  same black and white cat then 
  Mary started to chase them and 
 that took 2 minutes untill she finally 
  grabbed that cat mom was still 
   sleeping and I was really scared 
  then the cat and Mary started to 
  fight and I ran inside and got 
   a toy trew is that did not work 
  so I grabbed it and ran and 
  got her favorite treat placed it 
   on the floor and she ran right 
  to it. It was 7:00 am it was time 
  for breakfast "Where were you?" said mom 
  and I told her all about it. 
      It was a very good until I saw a...
            Bunny!
