One day in the morning I heared a loud crash. I 

woke up with my dog slobering all over me trying to 

wake me up. It wa a sunny Saturday morning, but when 

I got in my backyard but something seemed wrong. 

there was a giant pit dead smack in the middle of 

my pool, and inside of it was a rock. I told "Mr. Bark"

to stay away while I "inspected" it. I thought 

it could be a meteor... or an asteroid... maybe a 

comet.. whatever it was, I knew it was a big pit 

with a rock in it. So we didn't live happily after 

that (maybe.)
