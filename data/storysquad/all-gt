a shiny golden cover that said, "Designs for girls." She broght the book 
back to the table and started to skin through it. Then she saw a design 
that was absolutely beautiful, it had golden silk with red lace 
woven through it. Without hesitation, she started right to work. After 
2 more hours drawing and coloring, Pri and Julie were finaly done 
with their drawings. "So, how do you like mine?" Julie asked showing 
Pri her paper. It was a tunic with blue silk and green lace along
with high tops and navy jeans. "Its awesome! Now how about mine?" 
Pri asked showing Julie her drawing. It was a shirt with ripped jean shorts 
and the shirt was golden with white lace. "Well I think I like mine

better" said Julie. "Are you saing mine's not good?!" Pri said highly

But I was thinking of drawing something else" Pri said looking at the 
design book. "Suit yourself, I'm going to draw something similar to this

   I have the worst birthday. My brother 
Let me tell you want 
happened on my tenth
birthday. 
My brother woke me up when the sun started 
coming up. It was torture. Every year he sings this 
song to wake me up and it is so annoying.
 "Shut Up!" I told him. 
   "Do you want me to tell on you?" he 
asked.
   "I don't care just shut up!" I replied.
was born on the same exact 
day. He always 
   "Daddy!!" 
   I decided not to listen. After all I didn't care. 
Instead I tried my best to go back to sleep. I 
couldn't. So I got up and saw only my dad. 
" Hey dad," I said, "where's Mom?" Dad didn't
even hear me because he was to busy
playing and jumping around singing the 
annoying song with my brother So, I assumed Mom 
steals all the attention.
One year I got one 
gift while he got 10. 
It wasn't fair. I never 
have birthday parties. He 
gets them all. When I 
try to tell my parents 
they say, "He is only four. Give 
it a break."
   While he is only 
four I am ten. Later 
on I realized that this was 
the least of my problems. 
#2    5129
just went to do some last minute shopping.
"Of course not." I replied. Of course that
was not true. Why did he get tickets if there were 
 only two left? 
   While my brother was opening gifts, there were 
one for me cause Dad said they didn't know what s
to get, I was watching TV all by myself just like 
always. 
   When my dad and brother went to 
see the baseball game my mom came home.
   "How's your birthday so far ?" asked my mom.
I went to the kitchen to get myself some
   "What do you think?" I answered, "Nothing 
special has happened. It feels like any other 
day." 
   "Well I am about to make it better." 
said my mom. 
   My mom picked up a box she brought
in with her. At first I didn't notice it. I thought
it was more gifts for my brother, but then it started 
moving.
cereal when I heard an ear piercing scream.
   " What happened?" I yelled. I thought someone 
was in trouble. 
   " Daddy got me two tickets to a baseball game!" 
screamed my brother.
   "Sorry son, there were only two left," said my 
dad, "I hope you don't mind."

   "What's in the box?" I asked. She
didn't reply. She opened it and out came 
a puppy. 
   "What!" I said.s
   From then on I never complained about 
my brother.

The day I got my dog was the 
care. I wanted Bosco. My mother supported 
me in my decision. She would always
support me.
   "Lelina," She would say, "when the world 
falls apart and no one is there anymore,
know that I will be there. I'll stand on
your side when everyone on Earth is
against you. And when the choice comes,
your father and sister will too." 
   The only problem was that she wasn't
day my mother died. It wasn't the 
here anymore. She was gone. My world had 
gone with her.
   We drove home that fateful day and 
opened the front door. Bosco ran in and raced 
through every room. We chased after him 
screaming, "Bosco! Bosco come back!" He
didn't listen.
   We had decided on the name in the
car. Bosco just seemed so natural. 
dog's fault, it really wasn't. Bosco was 
already an old dog when I got him. My 
father had told me to got one of the
younger puppies so I could watch 
 him or her grow. My little sister 
was so taken by this young puppy that 
was bouncing around her feet. I didn't 
5130 #2
I looked at Bosco and the first thing that 
 those stories, but not in real life. Bosco
jumped onto the couch and leaped onto our low 
hanging chandelier. How did he even do 
that? He was supposed to be Old! 
   As soon as Bosco got onto the chandelier,
he ran, beginning to loosen it. We all backed 
away but my mother was too late....
Apparently there wasnt a lot holding our 
chandelier into the ceiling.
   It fell. Right on top of my mom. The
came to mind was Bosco. I don't know 
seconds in which the chandelier
 was falling I hoped and prayed that my 
mother would run, but she and I both
knew that there wasn't enough time. 
She looked at me and mouthed, "I will always
be there." And then she died. I was 
oblivious to the scream that escaped
my lips and the tears pouring down 
my face.
why.
   We finally caught up to Bosco in the
living room. We encompassed him and slowly
started moving around, making our circle 
tighter. That's when it happened. 
   When I think back, it seems like a fairytale 
sort of thing. Something that only happens in 
5130 #3
   The funeral was horrible. We 
   I guess I did come to terms with 
mother's death. Bosco helped me 
the most, because after a while, I realized
that my mother had wanted Bosco too, making
him another thing my mother had left
me.
   My father had wanted to get rid 
of Bosco. "Stupid dog," he said, "Killed
my wife." 
   I didn't let him. I explained my []
burned her, because that was what 
him and he grudgingly agreed. Secretly, 
I think that Bosco helped Father too.
He really is a sweet dog.
In the end, everything turned out okay. I
believe my mother got what she wanted in life. 
I'm happy if she's happy. She was happy 
so I am happy. My mother was right.
In a way, when I feel the worst, I
feel her presence. 
Even though She is not 
she had always wanted. Instead
of having her ashes kept, she had
wanted to be spread across the fields,
so she could live with nature.
Thats what we did. The only thing

'You must do it. You must track down the
giant."
That was my Father's last words to
me, before I was kicked out of the palace,
into the outside wilderness. Let me
explain. My name is Tony Kane, and
my Father is the King of Astenia.
We had been arguing over if I should
go out to find the famous giant, Sleth.
We have never captured him before, and
naturally my father wante him.
He told me that I should capture Sleth,
to prove to the Astenians that I should
become the king after he would die.
I, on the other hand, did not want this,
but my father did not care. At all.
Now I was feeling I had been abandoned
to set a silly prize my father wanted to
brag about. I hated it. But now, I felt
an anger; one that filled up with a
desire to capture Sleth, and to prove
to my Father that I was better than
being abandoned. But I decided that I
Should prove my worth to the Astenians
by helping them with their own
problems. After all, Sleth was not
bothering them.

going from door to door, day and night.
I helped each family out with their
biggest struggle, in exchange for
a promise: don't tell the king anything.
After the ten years, I came back
to the palace. to the same door that
I had gotten kicked out from.
I knocked on the door, and 2 seconds

Apparently he didn't care if I
was here or not. But when I
explained what had happeed, his
scowl at the beginning of my
explination slowly turned into a
chuckle at the end.
"I'm amazed. You earned the
Astenians respect, like I told you
too," he said. "Even though you
did not capture Sleth, you still have
my respect. You did a great job."
I stood there, so happy I was
