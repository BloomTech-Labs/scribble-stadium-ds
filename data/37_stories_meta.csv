XiChi,2020-10-23 16:33:27,"Once apon a time there was a girl named Mary. On a warm 
sunny day Mary was walking through the woods near hear nouse 
to look for some critters to take pictures of. She loved animals 
and nature all her life even though she was only nine years old 
She thinks that she is going to die soon. She does go to school 
but she isn't that smart. For example Mary recycled a pie 
even though the pie was not even bitten. Another thing she did 
was leave her muffin in the woods while she was traveling with  
her family to Andrea's house which is one of Mary's friends at 
school and Mary's muffin was eaten by a bear that sniffed it 
from far away. Yes. Mary could be a little weird but that is 
just how she is. Back to the real story now. Mary found a 
fox, took a picture she also found a rabbit took a picture 
she found a squirrel and took a picture before it ran away. 
But sooner or later she saw two eyes peeking through a bush 
on the side of the path she was walking on. Then the 
creature slowly came out of the bush. It was a bear. The bear 
growled at Mary. Mary was terrifyed. She started running and 
running but she could still see the bear growling behind her. This 
was the end of Mary. Mary was approaching her house she 
could see it now. She was safe in her house. She was now 
really scared. She could possibly be eaten but she made it to 
the door opened it and slammed it shut before the bear could 
get in. She ran or sprinted rather up to her room. ""I'm alive!!"" 
She cried. I just can't belive it I'm alive!!"" Mary was so 
relifed she told her mom and dad and her brother. And that 
night Mary was kissed goodnight and tucked into bed. And that 
is the only brave time of her life.",Photo 3101.jpg

                I am almost 12.^ MY birthday is in
                                   2 months.
Hello I am Bob. ^ I live a good life
with tempatures as hot as the summer 
in Texas. And by the way I live 
in Alaska. I don't know how but 
school is not as normal as it was 
             I'm the only child in my family.
in Virginia. ^ I miss Virginia. 
School here was alot of homework, 
no recess, and lunch was the same 
everyday which is the worst.
But life is getting better. ""Bob were
getting a new child."" said Mom. NO.
Where getting a younger sibling. The 
[illustration with caption] one time life goes good it 
[illustration with caption] goes back down to the 
[illustration with caption] worst. Ughh I don't like life.
[illustration with caption] Who knows my sibling could
gonna annoy me like crazy? Or 
can steal all the attention. Ughh this 
is like winter in Alaska. Today is my 
first day in 5th grade. ""Look at your 
lovely baby"" said Dad. What? I wispered.
I tried to act like I like it but that 
didn't go so well. My best friend Hayden 
moved to Nevada. So I have to make 
friends from scratch.""1 new Person 
is coming this year."" said Mike. Mike is 
my friend. But me and Hayden have been friends 
3115
for like 10 years. I always thought he 
would stay with me. ""Hey guys"" said 
the new kid Shyly. ""My name is 
Gerrard"". Now is lunch, and remember
when I said it was the same lunch 
every day well guess what today 
was cheeseburgers. Yay. It's usally 
corn on the cob. But today Gerrard 
got dissappointed that there was no 
recess. But then 4th grade, 3rd grade, and 
2nd grade all had recess. Mo fair!
The next day we had recess. Yay.It was 
-31◦F.""Brrr!"" We froze to death. We 
Played too joyfully I never got 
tagged because I'm the fastest 
in the school. So today I was 
BABYSITTING the baby. Why Mom?
""Because were going out to get ice cream
Said MOM.""Hey I want ice cream to"" 
I yelled. But Mom said no. Bummer.
The baby wasn't that bad until 
she cried becaue I was 
watching a tv show that was 
loud so I muted the volume like a 
sloth. Than He was awesome. Tommorow
everything was awesome. YaY!

"" This is my jungle. I had it first and you cannt not 
steal if from me."" screamed Lion. ""I have Known 
this jungle longer than you were born and it is 
a matter of time till I rule this jungle."" Tiger 
shot back at Lion. Tiger and Lion are having a 
fight because they think that one of them are the best 
and can rule over the jungle and if you want 
to know what the solution of the story is you have 
to keep reading but the only way to solve this 
problem is for Tiger and Lion to go to the peace-
keeper because they were once best friends. ""The only 
way to solve this problem is to go to the peacekeeper."" 
said Tiger. So in a tree probably taller than the sky
the peacekeeper went to work with Lion and 
Tiger. ""So what is the problem?"" the peacekeeper asked 
in a deep voice. ""We both want to rule the jungle."" 
They both said. The peacekeeper said ""Jungle Affwire
is a very old jungle but I have an idea. The idea 
that the peacekeeper had was Jungle Affwire will probably 
die in about two years so Tiger could rule for a 
year and Lion could rule for the last year and the
idea worked and Tiger and Lion had happy lives.",Photo 3118.jpg

Once there was a dog and cat that lived together and were nice 
to each other until one day were there were both playing outside
and this happened...
""OMG, a squirrel"" yelled Blister the dog as her ran after 
the furry rodent into the bushes of the yard.
""And he goes bozonkers again"" said Lion the cat 
as he was playing with a toy mouse. 
""I didn't go bozonkers just 'cause I wanted to catch a 
squirrel while you just play with your dumb old mouse."" 
Blister slightly shouted at his best friend. 
""You're the one who is for some reason alawys 
constantly chasing thocse poor old rodents,"" Lion 
shot right back at Blister. 
Then suddenly Blister jumped on Lion! 
""Get OFF me you incredibly bad dog!"" Lion yelled at 
Blister. So he got off and went inside for some 
love. Lion on his tail. This weird because instead of 
a dog chasing a cat there was a cat chasing the dog! 
""Settle down"" said the owner while seperating them. 
""How about we go for a walk"" said the owner as 
he brought out a leash Blister jumped up and 
soon they were out walking around the block. 
""Phew"" said Lion. 
""Now I get this whole place to myself"" said Lion. 
When Blister got back he was still in a fight 
with Lion and then they thought that should only 
worry about themselfs and not each other's business.",Photo 3122.jpg

""found it"" said Katrina, a villan who roamed around with her 
sidekick, Caterine. They were like cats, except humans. 
They were on the roof of tan apartment and were looking 
 for the museum they never stole from before. 
""lets go"" said Caterine as she did a double flip and 
 unleashed the whip around her waist, followed by 
 Katerina. The whip found a street light as they 
 wrapped it around and landed. they hurried in to 
 the building. ""You can guard and I will look for the 
 trophy"" said Caterine. ""No, I can look for it and 
 you can guard"" said Katrina. They argued but found 
 a plan. They would both look and Caterine's cat and 
 Katrina's kitten would guard because they were 
 very fierce. They soon found the trophy room and 
 Katrina used her claw tool to break the glass. They 
 took the trophy and hurried out but soon 
  they heard the alarm so they took out there 
  whips and wrapped it on the head of 
  the street light and pulled thmeselves 
   up they backfliped onto the building 
  behind them. ""Oh no! The kittens"" caterina 
 said, ""don't worry, I got them"" Katrina said. 
 But the police soon found them and said, 
""your coming with me"". He grabbed them 
and shoved them in the car. ""the kittens will 
be taken care of. They arrived at the 
Jail and were put in together. ""We will find a plan"" said 
Caterine..",Photo 3129.jpg

""Ughhh, this is going to take forever!"" Pri groaned leaning her head 
on the table. Pri and her friend Julie were designing a dress for 
a fashion show in Paris that was in 2 weeks. ""Cheer up Pri, we just 
started. I'm sure that we'll find an idea"" Julie said. ""Ooo, how about 
this?"" Julie said picking up a book with a cool design. ""Thats cool. 
But I was thinking of drawing something else"" Pri said looking at the 
design book. ""Suit yourself, I'm going to draw something similar to this 
design."" While Julie was drawing sketches, Pri got up to find another 
book to look at. While she was walking, she spoted a book that had 
a shiny golden cover that said, ""Designs for girls."" She broght the book 
back to the table and started to skin through it. Then she saw a design 
that was absolutely beautiful, it had golden silk with red lace 
woven through it. Without hesitation, she started right to work. After 
2 more hours drawing and coloring, Pri and Julie were finaly done 
with their drawings. ""So, how do you like mine?"" Julie asked showing 
Pri her paper. It was a tunic with blue silk and green lace along 
with high tops and navy jeans. ""Its awesome! Now how about mine?"" 
Pri asked showing Julie her drawing. It was a shirt with ripped jean shorts 
and the shirt was golden with white lace. ""Well I think I like mine 
better"" said Julie. ""Are you saing mine's not good?!"" Pri said highly 
insulted.  ""No!"" They fighted the rest of the time they were there. 
Then they went home. Pri went to her room, and all of a sudden 
something mind blowing happend. She called Julie and told her 
the idea to combind there creations, and she agreed! they 
worked and worked until the show and they both came

 I heard some rumbling and roaring,

 Oguk was about to say something

 ""The dragon!"" Oguk fired the trana

 gone,""Orgurk!"" Oguk called but as the 
  dragon was limping Ogurk jumped off 
 the rock and stabbed the dragon 
 making it crash into the ground.

My mother says I need to go to a place where people can relate to me. She wants 
us to move away. to a different part of the big, watery salad that the world is. 
""It's time to go, Hun,"" my mother yells from her office.
""No way. It's like you're trying to take the life out of me"" I have friends too. My mom 
needs to see that. 
""You know what? Fine. I'll give you 2 months. I'll see if work is getting any better."" 
I decide to make the most of what I have. Two months. But it's not like I 
can do anything. 
After all, I'm paralyzed. 
                                                      can
""How am I even supposed to make the most of this if I ^ only [] lie in 
bed and talk?"" 
""Call some of your friends."" 
""How am I supposed to pick up a phone?"" 
""I'll do it."" 
""Don't try to get caught up in my life."" 
""I'm not. You're the one picking a fight."" 
""Whatever, Mom! Pick up the phone and call Chari. But hold it up to my ear and 
DON'T LISTEN!"" 
""Well, okay then."" My mom picks up her cell phone. I can hear it ringing and 
then I hear Chari's mom. 
""Hello!"" 
""Hi. It's Rubin, Clara's mom."" 
""Oh hi! Chari's been dying to talk to Clara. After the accident... I'm so sorry."" 
""Oh, thank you, but Clara's feeling a lot better now."" 
""That's great to hear!"" 
""Maybe can Chari come over to hang out with Clara for a bit?"" 
""Chari would be delighted!"" 
5107 
""Also, do you know Avi's number?"" 
""Yup! I heard her hang up and call that number. 
""Hello?"" 
""Hi! Is this Avi?"" 
""Yes, who is this?"" 
""Robin, Clara's mother."" 
""Oh, salutations, Rubin! How's Clara?"" 
""Doing better. Chari's coming over, can Haddix?"" 
""[] Absolutely! He would be happy to!"" 
I hear all this and I realize I never got to talk to Chari or Haddix. 
""Are you kidding me, Mom?"" 
""No."" And she left. 
I was so sad and I thought about Balleitt, my best friend who is very sick. I feel 
            in[]ured
like I'm not [] enough compared to her. She has Lukemia, a form of cancer. 
She was always there for me. 
Chari and Haddix could not end up coming. 
And Balleitt died. 
My mom and I grew closer and closer after Balleitt's death. She was the glue 
that kept us together. 
And I will always remember what my mom told me: 
""Everyone has their share of life."" ",Photo 5107 pg1.jpg

""Your not going to town;"" said coach sasha, ""Your going to loose!"" 
I ignored her and continued to do my yurochenko. I love vault. It is my strongest 
event. But []now I was told I was going to loose. Hi. My name is Franchesca Smith 
and I love gymnastics. It is the best sport around. But my coach doesn't like my vault. She says it is 
too boring. I continued to do my yurochenkos when suddenly, I fell. I heard a really loud scream but 
I had no idea who it was. Then next thing I know I am at the hospital with a cast on my knee. 
"" What happened?"" [] I asked to my mom. She looked like she had just cried all night 
and did not sleeap. 
"" Well honey. You know your biggest rival out there, Levi davidson. She paid a guy to hit you in your 
                         boyfriend
knee. He had been her ex-[]. They thought [] you would beat her. So she took her chances and 
hit you."" I was flabbergasted. I was so mad, yet so in pain. I was going to the [] 
nationals and I couldn't compete And she could. 
 "" How long am I supposed to just lie around and do nothing?"" I asked. Still shucked. 
                              to do gymnastics again
 ""1 week. Then you will start ^ and maybe, just maybe be able to compete."" 
 So after a week, I was started to do my skills again. I was scared to do 
vault but I did it. [] 

  Then it was competition day. I saw Lexi []avidson priding herself with the poperazzi. 
 Well, I ignored her [] and did my vault. I stuck it and got a 9.652 and then it 
was Lexi's turn. She did a tsuk and got a 9.65. I had also got better 
scores on floor[] and bars. She beat me in beam. So I had [] 
won! I won! 
 "" Mom, I won!"" I had beaten Lexi. 
 "" Wait. What is happening to her?"" I asked Mom.
 "" She is getting stripped of her medals because she paid to hit you."" 
 I felt bad for her but I won and felt great.

   I lied awake waiting for something. I was alone with my 
thoughts, but all I could think of were chinchillas and milk 
that smelled like vinigar with eggs. I decide to go 
outside to walk my dog, Butch, he is a Yellow Lab. 
When I open the door I relize my whole world is 
going to change. I walk out the door and take Butch

a look that makes me know he understands. I wander 
around for a minute, and then I try to go back 
inside my house, but it is gone. Suddenly I look 
down and there is a Mosaic Chinchilla, my favorite kind. 
Beside it is 2 cup of milk. It is the kind that you 
might find in a cafeteria. I pick up the cup and it 
smells like vinigar mixed with eggs.

   I have the worst birthday. My brother 
was born on the same exact day. He always 
steals all the attention. One year I got one 
gift while he got 10. It wasn't fair. I never 
have birthday parties. He gets them all. When I 
try to tell my parents they say, ""He is only four. Give 
it a break."" 
   While he is only four I am ten. Later 
on I realized that this was the least of my problems. 
Let me tell you want happened on my tenth 
birthday. 
   My brother woke me up when the sun started 
coming up. It was torture. Every year he sings this 
song to wake me up and it is so annoying. 
 ""Shut Up!"" I told him. 
   ""Do you want me to tell on you?"" he 
asked. 
   ""I don't care just shut up!"" I replied. 
So he went. 
   ""Daddy!!"" 
   I decided not to listen. After all I didn't care. 
Instead I tried my best to go back to sleep. I 
couldn't. So I got up and saw only my dad. 
"" Hey dad,"" I said, ""where's Mom?"" Dad didn't 
even hear me because he was to busy 
playing and jumping around singing the 
annoying song with my brother So, I assumed Mom 
 5129 
just went to do some last minute shopping. 
I went to the kitchen to get myself some 
cereal when I heard an ear piercing scream. 
   "" What happened?"" I yelled. I thought someone 
was in trouble. 
   "" Daddy got me two tickets to a baseball game!"" 
screamed my brother. 
   ""Sorry son, there were only two left,"" said my 
dad, ""I hope you don't mind."" 
   ""Of course not."" I replied. Of course that 
was not true. Why did he get tickets if there were 
 only two left? 
   While my brother was opening gifts, there were 
none for me cause Dad said they didn't know what 
to get, I was watching TV all by myself just like 
always. 
   When my dad and brother went to 
see the baseball game my mom came home. 
   ""How's your birthday so far ?"" asked my mom. 
   ""What do you think?"" I answered, ""Nothing 
special has happened. It feels like any other 
day."" 
   ""Well I am about to make it better."" 
said my mom. 
   My mom picked up a box she brought 
in with her. At first I didn't notice it. I thought 
it was more gifts for my brother, but then it started 
moving.
5129 
   ""What's in the box?"" I asked. She 
didn't reply. She opened it and out came 
a puppy. 
   ""What!"" I said. 
   From then on I never complained about 
my brother. ",Photo 5129 pg2.jpg

In the summer two friends were talking. 
 Bob the alien said, ""It's so hot outside. I'm like 
 literally melting. Can we go inside?"" Her friend 
 Zoe responded,"" I wanted to go get ice cream 
 inside anyway. Wanna come?"" Inside the girls 
  got ice cream, but Bob was scooping the ice 
  cream while Zoe was in the bathroom 
 washing her hands. When she returned the 
 ice cream was already in the bowls. ""Aaagh!"" 
 screamed Zoe,""You put worms in my ice cream!"" 
 ""No, I didn't,"" replied Bob who was confused,""When 
  I was scooping the ice cream there were no 
  worms."" ""Whatever, but, by the way. I'm not 
  coming back to your house anymore. I've 
  got better things to do,"" Zoe angerily replied 
  before storming out the door. On the way 
  out, she drops the bowl, and worms 
  suddenly starts crawling out. ""Weird, I only 
 was away for 5 seconds to put away the 
               the 
 ice cream and ^ scooper thing,"" said Bob. 
 For a week at a summer camp that they 
 had together, Zoe ignored Bob. After the 
 summer camp ended, Bob recieved texts from 
 Zoe, but it wasn't that pleasant. It was 
 angry, mean texts saying that Bob had no 
  more friends because Bob had gotten into 
                                           5206
                   because Zoe had told Bob
                      her password
 Zoe's social media^. ""I didn't do that!"" exclaimed 
Bob when she pieced the story together. 
When they all got back to school in the fall, 
Bob was iced out, but she went up to Zoe 
to say that she didn't hack into Zoe's 
accound, but Zoe only replied, ""I'll believe you, but 
you need to find the person who did it, and tell 
them that I won't be mad."" Zoe's friend 
Grace stood up and said,"" Zoe, no need to 
be mad at Bob, it was me who hacked 
into your account because I didn't want you 
to be hanging out with Bob so much, I 
wanted to hang out with you more. I'm 
really sorry. Oh! By the way, I overheard you 
telling your password to Bob."" ""Thanks for 
confessing, by the way,"" Zoe said, ""But you 
should have just told me that! But okay! Thanks!""

                     named Timothy Browns
There once was a boy ^ who lived in a cottage 
in a large forest. One day he told his mother, ""I'm going 
to take a walk in the forest. ""Yes, you may do as 
you wish,"" his mother replied. Timothy wondered what he would 
come by on this adventure. As he strolled through the forest 
Timothy found something he never noticed. A large cave 
sat in the side of a boulder. Timothy, being a curious 
wanderer, ventured into the mysterious new cave After 
walking around for a minute or two, Timothy came uon a 
small cavern crowded by rocks on the ground. But there 
was something else about this cavern. A blue glow was 
coming from . the walls and floating around the room. 
It was bonding to the rocks and made them 
seem like they were hovering off the ground. Timothy 
wanted to see what this magical force was doing.So 
he got on his knees and picked up one of the 
rocks. It felt lighter than most rocks. Suddenly, 
The rock flew out of timothy's hand and hit 
  an other rock. Then like a tornado all the rocks spun 
around and all cane together. When the dust settled, 
in front of Timothy was a rock figure. With blue 
 glowing eyes and two small rock ears. He said, ""Hi, I am"" 
then it paused and said, ""I don't have a name."" Timothy 
marvled at the new creaure he had discovered. ""Woah."" 
They becane friends but Timothy couldn't think 
 of a name eventually he naned him Rocky.",Photo 5210.jpg

   I walk into the Crying Boy Tavern, my 
sword hung over my shoulder. ""Here's your 
souvenir,"" I say as I put the claw of 
Supreme Warlord Slog-Dog, the kind of 
orcs, onto a table. ""So the beast is dead,"" 
my buyer says. ""Didn't stand a chance 
against the Sword of Souls,"" I answer. 
"" I'll give you one more task, slay the 
treant that lurks in the bottom of 
the midnight's hole,"" my buyer tells 
me. ""Whatever,"" I say back. He opens 
a portal and I walk through, in front 
of me lies one tree. I approach it 
and it comes to life. ""Who dares to come 
into the midnight's hole?"" the treant 
asks. ""Let's make this quick,"" I say, 
""either you give me one of your branches 
or I take it with force."" ""Little hero, 
you have no chance against me,"" he says 
as he swings his mighty arm. ""I'm guessing 
Heinzd'all sent you,"" the tree booms. ""Who 
is Heinzd'all?"" I ask. ""Your buyer, 
he is a demon from the very depths of 
this hole."" ""Enough of this!"" I shout. 
I launch myself off of a rock and 
frantically swing my sword. Surprisingly, 

he counters every blow. ""That's not 
possible!"" I howl. ""Don't trust your 
buyer, or else he will betray you just 
as he betrayed many others!"" the tree 
booms. ""How did he betray them?!"" I 
loudly ask. ""He sent them here with 
the Sword of Souls, he knew the curse 
and knew the heroes would die,"" the beast 
continues, ""look at the skeletons 
here!"" ""My buyer is a kind man, he 
works at orphanages and clears the 
land of horrible monsters!"" I shout 
back. "" Sadly you are incorrect, now it 
is time for you to meet the others!"" 
he howls as he strikes. I roll to 
the side, but he is prepared. He grabs 
me and I go up. ""Now you meet your 
end, little hero,"" he keeps talking, ""The 
buyer's evil drive caused him to 
tell you you had a chance, but he was 
lying, he is trying to kill you!"" ""You 
are not correct!"" I scream as I leap 
from his clutches and jab my sword 
deep into his wooden head. ""You are the 
one to..."" his voice getting softer, seeming 
as though every word is more challenging
                                        5213
than the last, ""defeat me."" As the 
now lifeless treant falls to the ground, 
I wonder about the argument we just 
had. The tree was ready, the skeletons 
were everywhere, but my buyer never gave 
me the Sword of Souls. What was 
the tree talking about? These thoughts 
still did not leave my head as I 
walked through the portal to get back 
to the Crying Boy Tavern. When my 
buyer, apparently named ""Hei'nzd'all"" saw 
me, he nearly jumped into orbit. ""E-Eric, 
you survived!"" he stuttered. ""You sent 
me to my death!"" I yelled a little 
too loud. ""N-no, I-I-I kn-n-new y-y-you 
were to t-to the ch-ch-challenge,"" he 
sounded terrified. ""I'm not letting you 
hurt anyone else,"" I said as I 
raised my sword. ""N-n-n-noooooooo!"" 
he shouted as I brought it down. 
""Keep the money, and I'll keep both 
my and your lives,"" I was done with 
monster hunting, my buyer was no more, 
and no one would be terrorized by 
the evil treant that lived in the 
bottom of the midnight's hole.

""But why. Human look at me weirdly unless I am with 
another human like you."" 
""Just learn to deal with it. It was been two years 
that you have been my pet and you still have not 
been able to deal with it,"" says Sebastion while flushing 
 the toilet. ""Okay, here is how we need to deal with 
  this. You must be by yourself for one week, mabey 
 go visit your mom. Then, you will be roaming around 
 in the human world for another week.""
 ""Okay,"" responded Draco. 

 The first two days of The Plan was weird 
for both. Draco had no one to play with, although 
 dragons were solitary creatu[]s, demestication did 
 something to Draco. Sebastian just lost his 
 best friend, so you can imagine how that was going.

[] From that third day onward sebastion started 
 feeling better. He had other friends that kept him 
company. 

Draco also started feeling beter,but more importantly, he 
got better at living without sebastion. The week past 
 and it was time for phase two of The Plan. Draco moved 
 back into the human world. The stairs did not 
  feel good. It made him want to go back, but 
  he trusted Ssebastion. After the first few days, Draco 
  startd ignoring the looks. Sure they kept coming but il 
  didn't affect Dracto. [] On the last day was 
  when Draco truely got to learn how to not [] always 
  want to follow Sebastion. What he learned is still unknown 
  to this day but it sure helped. Draco compleatly 
 stopped following Sebastion and there friendship was [] 
 [] fully [] restored.

 Once upon a time, there was a beetle clan named the Artemites. The 
 Artemites lived in a big tree in a jungle. Now, there was a rival clan 
 named the Kaydites. The Kaydites lived in the tree next to it. Since 
 they lived in the same area, they fought often for the land. They 
would send armies and everything. In both of these respected clans []ero
two young beetles named Michael and Jean. They had been taught 
 to fight the other, but secretely sought peace. They both 
 were very skilled fighters and were in the army. One day, the 
 tow came across each other during an encounter. ""You fight well,"" 
Jean said. ""You as well,"" replied Michael. These boys deliberately tried 
as hard as they could to avoid killing off the enemy. As the 
encounter ended and they were leaving, they had som parting words. 
""You're like me. You seek peace, don't you?"" said Michael. ""I do,"" replied 
Jean, ""Follow me, I know a pathway where we can talk more."" 

When the boys headed down the path and into the hole, nobody 
saw them. ""So, what is your name?"" asked Michael. ""Jean. And 
 you?"" replied Jean. ""Michael,"" responded Michael. ""Look, I know this 
sounds crazy, but we must find peace,"" said Michael. ""Are you insane?! 
 We cannot overthrow the clans."" ""We must. Are you really 
 ready to give up your dream?"" ""Fine,"" said Jean, ""We'll give 
 it a try."" 

 Over the course of a month they met in the same 
 place everyday. but one day, when their plan was ready, 
they waited for the next encounter. Their plan was 
                                                    5227
 to spread a scent that puts everyone in the area to sleep. 
 They release the scent they had been working on for months 
and... BOOM! The gas exploded. 

When all the beatles woke up, the boys went up to explain 
their idea. The commanders from their respective clans agreed. 
Peace was made! The boys were speechless. They saved their 
 clans! 

 The clans never fought again and the boys went on to 
 be lifetime friends.

Once upon a time there was 2 animals, a bunny named, Billy 
and a hedgehog name, Jerry. Jerry saw Billy playing at the park 
with his friends. Billy's friends do not really like Jerry, so when 
they saw Jerry, they ran away, but Billy walked up to Jerry and 
said, ""Would you like to play with us?"" When Jerry heard the question 
he was so happy. Billy and Jerry went to Billy's friends and said, 
""Let's play!"" Billy's friends took Billy to the side and murmured, 
""No way we're playing with him!"" Billy whispered back, ""Fine we don't 
have to play with him, but what about giving him at least one chance."" 
They screamed back at him, ""NO!!"" 

Billy and his friends walk up to Jerry and they all give their 
opinion. Billy's friends went first. They said things like, ""You are 
selfish, annoying, and mean!"" Jerry almosst cried but he kept 
himself together. Jerry screamed ""Fair enough!"" and ran away. 
Billy did not know what to say so he followed his friends. 
Billy's friends found Jerry crying. Jerry said, ""Leave me alone."" 
Billy's friends started to scream, ""Cry baby! Cry baby!"" 
Jerry screamed at them, ""Why are you picking on me?!"" They 
said, ""You are so weak!"" Jerry threw his thorns at them. 
Billy's friends said, ""Fine we will play with you

""5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1, ready or not here I come!"" screamed Hanah. 
I was rushing for a place to hide. My eyes crossed the 
closet, I pushed open the door, ""You snooze you lose!"" snickered 
James. I saw the cabinet, I sprinted across the 
creaky wooden floors. ""Find somewhere else!"" 
whispered Jessica. This was my time, my place to 
shine, I raced into the basement. This was my 
chance to show my siblings that I could be 
just as great as them at hide and seek. I 
stepped in the basement, and closed my eyes. I was 
always afraid of the dark. I stepped into the 
doorway, and then from there, I fell into the 
darkness. 

   It felt like I would fall forever, there 
was a sudden thud as I fell to the ground. 
 It was pitch black, other then a speck of light. 
I ran and ran towards the speck of light. It 
was a door, a golden door. It was paved with 
jewels of all different colors. I opened it, and 
 I walked through, a whole new word appeared 
in front of my eyes. I looked back and the 
door faded. 

   A creature like thing whipped past me, ""I'm 
late! I need to go!"" it hollered. I looked ahead, 
                                   5235
 it seemed to be a gathering. A honk filled 
the air. Someone was blowing a horn. A tall 
woman rised into the air, her hair was pulled 
back tightly into a bun. I saw the creature again, 
it was a camel, with a neck of an ostrich, and 
 two ears of a fennec fox. I ran over to the 
 meeting, I hid behind a large rock. ""Do you 
 love me?"" The tall girl bellowed. The group 
screamed yes. It seemed as if the creature 
wasn't into it, the creatures didn't even say 
yes. ""You,"" the women pointed to the creature, ""guards, 
get him! He dares not to scream for me!"" 
""No, no, I do love you, you are our belved 
queen!"" He was pushed out of the gathering. 
 I rushed over to him,""Hi, my name is Caroline,"" 
 I whispered. ""You, you are the only one who 
can save us from this cruel queen,"" he said. 
""Sorry, me?"" I asked. ""Yes, you. My name is 
Ben,"" he said. ""You are the only one who can 
save us. You must take down our Queen Ethol. 
Your mother was the queen back in the day. She 
was the most prized possesion of our kingdom. 
She ruled with peace and love, until her sister 
was revealed the older of the two. Your aunt 
then became queen."" Ben explained. ""You knew 
my mother?"" I asked. ""Everyone knew your 
mother,"" he said. 
                                   5235
 ""What must I do to save everyone. My 
mother always told me that violence wasn't 
the answer."" I said. ""You must make her feel 
ashamed, that's what she hates the most!"" 
Ben exclaimed. ""But I know nothing about her! 
 I don't know how to make her feel ashamed. I 
said. ""Just think, she is your aunt after all,"" 
 said Ben. She is ashamed of something, ""All 
 I know is that she was jealous of her sister."" 
 I thought back to my childhood, a sudden 
 image popped into my head. It was of my 
 mother and the queen casting a spell. I ran 
over to the gathering, ""You are ashamed of 
your sister!"" the whole crowd gasped. 
 ""You can't cast a spell, and my mother can!"" 
 The queen chased after me. I screamed 
for the guards, ""don't listen to her! Be free!"" 
 I said. The guards grabbed the queen, 
 Ben thanked me. A golden door popped up 
 in front of me, I stepped in, waving good-
 bye to all of my subjects. I was back to 
 the staircase where it had all begun.

     Lynda's Part of the Story
  Hello. my name is Lynda and I live a very unusual 
life. My family is gone, I was alone, and I'm a 
wereworld. Let me tell you my story. 
  It was a dark windy night with my family 
in our hut. It was just another gloomy 
night. I was hungry, so I left our hut 
 to get some berries. When I came back 
 a nightmare came to life. 
   I was watching my family of werewolves 
getting kidnapped by humans. They weren't 
killed. however they were getting pushed into a 
 truck. The last thing I remember was my 
 mom mouthing the words run. The humans 
 turned my way. That was the fastest I 
 had ever run in my life. 

      Mark's part of the story 
   Hi, [] my name is Mark. I 
am a hunter of all the werewolves. This may 
sound cruel but let me tell you my story. 
   I was just a kid at the time but my parents 
were away on a business trip. I was with my 
 grandma who I loved dearly. One day I found 
                  on the porch 
 my grandma crying ^ and asked her what 
 was wrong. She looked surprised to see me there 
 but reluctantly said, ""Your parents are gone."" 
                                        5236
 For a while that never registered with me 
but when I finally understood I became 
curious. What happened on the night of their 
death? One day I found the courage to 
ask. My grandma never hid anything from me 
but she did this once. She only said one 
word to me, ""Werewolves."" That was the 
day I decided all werewolves had to die. 
 None should be forgiven. 

     Lynda's Part 
  I settled down and started weeping. 
How could this happen. I stayed there for 
a while when someone picked me up. They 
 took me into their house where I continued 
 weeping. I didn't know what was happening 
 all I knew was that they were a human. 
 I continued to scratch untill they gave 
 me a pill I fell asleep within seconds. 

     Mark's Part
   I became a hunter of all wolves. The 
dangerous and the small. Not a single one 
could be innocent. They all were bad is 
what I told myself. I then [] went 
home to hear crying upstairs. I didn't 
                               5236
     []
 have ^ [] little sibling. I wondered 
who this was. 

    Lynda's part 
   I woke up from my slumber to an old 
lady smiling at me. I started scratching 
at her but she held me tight. ""Calm 
 down,"" is what she said. I started to 
 trust her. 

    Mark's Part 
   I went upstairs into my house and 
 saw no one. Not even my grandma but 
 the noise had stopped. One thing I 
 noticed however is that their was 
 a ladder leading up to the ceiling. I 
 climbed up to a terrifying sight. 

     Afterwards I s 
   Mark went up and saw his Grandmother 
cradling a small Werewolf. I freaked 
out. ""Grandmother what are you doing?!?"" 
I talked with them both and found out 
not all werewolves are bad. Some are 
good like this poor one. []

   [] [] Ending                 5236
  Now Lynda and Mark are married. 
The Grandmother helps them take care 
of their hybrid child Stella. They 
all love each other.[][] The 
world went to peace between people 
and werewolves.

I found you outside my house, in my yard, one wing 
bent, with some feathers missing. A soft coo emitted 
from your throat, and pity welled inside of me. 
""Don't worry,"" I told you. ""I'm here,"" I said. I 
cupped you in my hands. You were my treasure. 
I nursed you and fed you, and gave you a home. 
You were my best friends. I Knew you had to go 
 someday, but I brushed that thought aside. 
 ""Surely you will always be with me,"" I thought. 
 ""You are my only true friend."" You were with 
 me for the good times, and the bad times. You 
 grew bigger and healthier, and I knew it was 
 almost time to realse you from your cage. 
 I loved you so much, it hurt to think of you 
 leaving. I felt conflicted. I wanted you to be 
 free, but my greed and selfishness pinned me 
 down. ""I love you,"" I would whisper. But saying 
 that only made me sadder. Selfishness is some-
 thing all humans possess. I could not help it. 
 But eventually, I Knew the day had come. 
 I had to let you go. I took your cage to 
 my yard. The place where I found you. 
 ""You will always be my very, very best friend,"" 
 I whispered. ""I will always be by your side."" 
 Then, with one small movement of my hand, 
 you were set free. You flew away my treasure, a 
 free, healthy bird.

her family was going to a forest to camp and have a good 
summer there. ""Jane are you done packing"" he father asked 
""We are leaving soon"" he said ""Almost done give me a

down stairs to join her mother, father, and her dog. ""I am 
here"" said Jane. ""Ok you reddy to go?"" asked her Mother 
""Yes"" replied Jane, ""Ok let's go."" said her Mother as they packed 
up the car and got in the car. Jane's father asked ""Do 
you know where we are going!"" ""No, are we staying in 
Mane or going some where else"" asked Jane. ""No we are 
staying in Mane"" said the Mother. They started to 
drive off continueing their conversation. ""How far 
are we?"" asked Jane. ""like 2 and 1/2 hours or so"" said 
her dad. ""Well then I am going to sleep"" said Jane. 
Jane such fell asleep and was a sleep for a 
bit more than a hour and Jane woke up to a 
sound of metal being crunched. Jane shot up wide 
awake she exclaimed ""What was that"" the car was 
stopped at that point She could hear her dog 
barking next to her. ""The car got hit by 
another car,"" said Jane's mother, ""but no one got 
hurt,"" she said. By this point Jane's dad was off 
of his shock by the car getting hit and got 
out of the car to see exactly what hap[]d. 
Jane could hear her dad talking to other people. 

When her dad finaly went back into the car he informed 
them that the car was hit by antoher car and 
another car hit that car. ""But no one is hurt"" 
said her dad. ""luckley"" he added ""Wow"" exclamed Jane

    It was [] hot[] summer evening, 
  and I was sitting at my desk, staring 
 at my dead fish at the very bottom of the 
tank. I sat there, licking my popsicle and 
thought about getting another fish to replace 
[] this one. But before I asked my parents 
 for another one, I thought to myself, This 
 would be my 6th fish. Do you really want 
 another one?
    My parents only allow me to have a fish or 
a small bird. That's it. But what I really 
long for is a [] bigger pet, like a dog or cat. 
For three years, my two brothers and I are always 
asking for a pet other than just a fish 
or frog. We even put together a seven paged 
perssuasive essay! Every year for my birthday, I 
always ask for a different pet.[] My birthday 
 is just two weeks away, but I don't 
 think I'll be getting one no matter how 
 much I ask. My parents think that it's 
 such a big responsibility to take care of 
 a pet like a dog. But at least I'm 
 not longing for something so crazy 
 like my brothers. Their strongest 
 desire is to have a pet crocodile! 
 I know that they will never get one.

   I just can't wait until I finally 
get my own dog, cat, goat, whatever 
it might be. I [] sat there, sucking 
on my bright blue popsicle, [] pondering. 
Half an hour passed, and [] suddenly, 
I had an epiphony. ""I got it!"" I 
[] hollered. My brothers came racing 
into the room. ""The plan?"" Jamie asked 
with a huge grin. Jamie is [] the oldest 
brother. He's a sophmore in high school 
and is 16.
      ""Yes,"" I replied. 
      ""Well, come on! The sooner [] you 
[] share it, the soon we can get it!"" 
exclaimed my other brother Carson. 
Carson is in Eight Grade. He's 14. 
    [] Reader, you are probably thinking: 
what could this plan be? [] Since 
last year, we've been planning a 
way to get our pet.

   Commandere Cragg was worried. His team had 
crashed into a bog on planet Denegar, and 
they seemed to be stuck. 
    He walked over to his trusted aide, 
Captain Zev. ""Any news?"" he asked.
    ""No.""
    The clones walked toward their smoking 
 escape pod. The charred husk of the pod reminded 
  the two of their dead brothers. Then the pod 
 carrying the clones had landed, only two 
 clones had made it out of the ill-fated

 to pour in. He returned their fire until 
 forced to retreat. ""Go!"" 
     The clone [] divison - Reek, Seven, Ate, and 
 Deviss - ran. Cragg laid down covering fire until[]
it became too late. He sprinted with 
 his men. 
     They couldn't possibly know, but their 
 starship was about to blow.

  Outside, the droid ship Malevolence waited. 
On boar[] stood General Grievious. His skeletal, 
 imposing frame seemed to take up the 
 whole ship, and his rasping breath hinted 
 at a great evil within. 
        This was darkness. 
       Grievious ordered the ion cannons 
 to fire. They immediately knocked out 
 every single power[] source on the republic 
 ship. 
       The ship was doomed. 
       As the power cut off on the ship, 
 Cragg sighed. He hated to do this, but it 
 was clear it was the only way. 
       ""Abandon ship,"" he said. 
       They sprinted to the escape 
pods. 
       As they got there, they saw 
that the power there was out too. 
The only way to launch it was a 
manual lever - that had to be yanked 
by someone outside th pod. 
       Cragg resigned himself to his fate. 
""I'll do it,"" he said grimly ⎾                      ⏋

       You must go on for the Republic.""
       At nodded, resignedly.

                                    - 5254 pg 3 
       [] Cragg started to push the lever - he never

          Ate sighed. ""Get him in."" Seven and Deviss

 they only fought harder. 
      ZRM! The Jedi's light Saber 
    hummed.

Holmes,2016-11-30 22:24:44,"The story of Mr. Fox         -  5263
One sunny evening in a forest there was 
a wolf and a Fox, the wolf's name was 
Holz, and the Fox's name was just Mr. Fox. 
They were best friends for very long until 
last year where Holz made Mr. Fox leave 
school with him and go to forests to hunt. 
Later on, Holz just bossed Mr. Fox around, 
Mr. Fox never complained or said anything 
to make Holz stop, but today, this evening, 
he will make Holz pay for what he 
did...
     Holz and Mr. Fox were ready to go to 
dinner, they were right next to a barn. 
""Check if there are anyone,"" Holz told Mr. Fox. 
He just answered with a nod and ran into 
the barn. The animals were locked inside 
a big barn house, luckily, there was 
a small hole to enter the house. After 
Mr. Fox went in, he was so excited. The 
barn was filled with sheeps and no 
human. 
""All checked,"" yelled Mr. Fox, ""come here!"" 
     Holze ran there as fast as he could 
and was impressed. They didn't talk at all 
and started eating. Every few seconds, 
Mr. Fox went throw the hole and check out-
side and came back. There and back, there 
                                    5263
and back. 
   Holz was curious so he asked, ""what are 
 you doing?"" 
  Mr. Fox answered, ""I... um... am just checking if 
anyone was here."" 
   Suddenly, A human came from the back door 
carrying a Moisin Nagat and a cane. Mr. Fox 
zipped throw the hole as fast as he could, 
but Holz was stucked at the hole because he 
ate way to much! That is when Holz realized 
that everytime when Mr. Fox went threw the 
door, he was trying to figure out how much 
to each more. The human shot Holz and died. 
Mr. Fox was more than happy. He was finally free...
