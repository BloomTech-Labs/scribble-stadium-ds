### Story Squad Data

- Children's story submissions are not able to be made public due to [COPPA](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16%3A1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5) guidelines, and our team decided to extend that to transcriptions as well out of precaution. 
- The `squad_score_metrics` csv file in this folder contains the Squad Score v1.1 metrics from all 167 provided stories in our training data set, and was generated from the `squad_score_mvp` notebook. 
   - features: story_id, story_length, avg_word_len, quotes_num, unique_words_num, adj_num, squad_score
- Anyone with access to the Story Squad data can download any of the notebooks in this repository to generate any additional needed csv files.
