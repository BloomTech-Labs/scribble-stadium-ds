#### Overview of `notebooks` content:
- `submission_endpoint_interactions`: This Notebook demonstrates the functionality for `submission.py` endpoints and outlines the file structure that is required from the endpoints `UploadFile` type.
- `squad_score_mvp`: This notebook contains data exploration of training data, generation of MinMaxScaler, and Squad Score formula composition for complexity metric. Also produces `squad_score_metrics.csv` which contains a row for each training data transcription. Features include `story_id`, all features used in the most recent Squad Score formula, and `squad_score`.
- `count_spelling_errors`: This notebook contains exploration of various spell check libraries to explore whether spell check could correct transcription errors, act as a metric for student writing, and/or increase the reliability of other metrics. For the time being, we did not see enough improvement and consistency to implement this feature.
- `transcribed_stories`: This notebook connects to the Google Cloud Vision API and transcribes the given 167 stories. Produces the `transcribed_stories.csv` which includes the Submission ID and the Transcribed Text. The `transcribe` method is used to create `transcription.py` which is used in the app. 
- `transcription_confidence`: This notebook explores Google Cloud Vision API's method to return confidence levels of its transcription. Produces the `error_confidence.csv` which includes story_id, error (calculated between the api transcription and provided human transcription) and confidence for each submission. The `image_confidence` method is modified to create the `confidence_flag.py` which is used in the app.
