English-word-bank


In Need of creating random sentences within the vocabulary range of kids ages 5-13, a word bank creation was required. While searching for a dataset with English words categorized as Verbs, nouns, prepositions and places, I found the following data and merged them to create a word bank dictionary. This dictionary contains only
