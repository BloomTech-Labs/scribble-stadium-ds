## Trained Models
Models are automatically saved to the name `storysquad.traineddata` in `tesstrain/data`, and new models will overwrite the old ones if not moved to another directory or renamed. So this is the directory you want to move them to, once youâ€™ve trained your model!


As of 10/2021

-Our best performing model (`storysquadalldata4.traineddata`) gives an accuracy of 61% on a neat handwriting image (full_sample2.png). 
-I have documented how we arrived at this accuracy in the `tesseract-model training` dir README.md
- This model doesn't perform well on children's handwriting (check `tesseract-model training` dir for details)
